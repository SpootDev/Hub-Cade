32X, Sega, 1994


The Sega 32X, codenamed Project Mars, is an add-on for the Mega Drive/Genesis video game console by Sega. Its aim was to increase the lifespan of the aging Mega Drive/Genesis system, which was facing stiff competition from the SNES. While connecting it to Mega Drive did increase its capabilities, reluctance to adapt due to the previous failure of the Mega-CD and the upcoming Sega Saturn system led to low sales and a short lifespan. It was distributed under the name Sega Super 32X in Japan, Sega Genesis 32X in North America, Sega Mega Drive 32X in the PAL region, and Sega Mega 32X in Brazil (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_32X).

Sega CD (USA, NTSC, w/32X), Sega, 1994


The Mega-CD (??CD Mega Shi Di?) (Sega CD in North America) is an add-on device for the Mega Drive video game console, designed and produced by Sega and released in Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and North America. The device adds a CD-ROM drive to the Mega Drive, allowing the user to play CD-based games and providing additional hardware functionality. The Mega-CD can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs. The development of the Mega-CD was confidential; game developers were not made aware of what exactly they were working on until the add-on was finally revealed at the Tokyo Toy Show in Japan. The Mega-CD was designed to compete with the PC Engine CD (TurboGrafx-16 CD) in Japan, which had a separate CD-ROM drive. The first version of the Mega-CD sits underneath the Mega Drive console and loads CDs via a motorized tray. A second version places a top-loading CD-ROM drive to the right of the console and is intended primarily for use with the redesigned Sega Mega Drive 2. Both versions of the Mega-CD are compatible with the initial two versions of the Mega Drive console, but not with the Mega Drive 3 or Genesis 3 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega-CD).

3DO (NTSC), 3DO, 1991


The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (often called simply 3DO) is a video game console originally produced by Panasonic in 1993. Further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by Sanyo and Goldstar. The consoles were manufactured according to specifications created by The 3DO Company, and were originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technology Group. The system was conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. Despite a highly-promoted launch (including being named Time magazine's "1994 Product of the Year") and a host of cutting-edge technologies, the 3DO's high price (US$699.95 at launch), limited third-party developer support, and an over-saturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to competitors Sega and Nintendo. This console was released in North America on October 4, 1993, and in Japan on March 20, 1994. In 2009, video game website IGN chose the 3DO as its 22nd greatest video game console of all time, out of its list of 25 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer).

In 2009, video game website IGN chose the 3DO as its 22nd greatest video game console of all time, out of its list of 25. Price drops announced in February 1996 were perceived in the industry to be an effort to improve market penetration before the release of the promised successor of 3DO, the M2. Heavy promotional efforts on the YTV variety show It's Alive and a stream of hinted product expandability supported that idea; however, the M2 project was eventually scrapped altogether (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer).

Amiga 1000 (NTSC), Commodore Business Machines, 1985


The A1000, or Commodore Amiga 1000, was Commodore's initial Amiga personal computer, introduced on July 23, 1985 at the Lincoln Center in New York City. Machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256 kB of RAM at the retail price of 1,295 USD. A 13-inch (330 mm) analog RGB monitor was available for around 300 USD bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to 1,595 USD. Before the release of the Amiga 500 and A2000 models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called Amiga. In the US, the A1000 was marketed as The Amiga from Commodore, however the Commodore logo was omitted from the casing. Additionally the Amiga 1000 was exclusively sold in computer stores, rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores the VIC20 and Commodore 64 were retailed in. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's "toy-store" computer image created during the Tramiel era (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1000).

Atari 1200XL, Atari, 1982


The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers manufactured from 1979 to 1992. All are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU and were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips. Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the original Atari 400 and 800 and their successors, the XL and XE series of computers. Overall, the Atari 8-bit computer line was a commercial success, selling two million units through its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985[1], a total of around 4 million units (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_1200XL).

Atari 130XE, Atari, 1986


Jack Tramiel's Atari Corporation produced the final machines in the 8-bit series, which were the 65XE and 130XE (XE stood for XL-Expanded). They were announced in 1985, at the same time as the initial models in the Atari ST series, and visually resembled the Atari ST. Originally intended to be called the 900XLF, the 65XE was functionally equivalent to the 800XL minus the PBI connection. The 65XE (European version) and the 130XE had the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI), which was electronically almost compatible with the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI), but physically smaller, since it was located next to the standard 400/800-compatible Cartridge Interface and provided only those signals that did not exist in the latter; ECI peripherals were expected to plug into both the standard Cartridge Interface and the ECI port. The 130XE shipped with 128 KB of memory, accessible through bank-selection (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_130XE).

Atari 2600 (NTSC), Atari, 1977


The Atari 2600 is a video game console released in October 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and cartridges containing game code, instead of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware with all games built in. The first game console to use this format was the Fairchild Channel F; however, the Atari 2600 receives credit for making the plug-in concept popular among the game-playing public. The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200, in 1982, the VCS was renamed "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a cartridge game—initially Combat and later Pac-Man. The Atari 2600 was wildly successful, and during much of the 1980s, "Atari" was a synonym for this model in mainstream media and, by extension, for video games in general. In 2009, the Atari 2600 was named the second greatest video game console of all time by IGN (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600).

Atari 2600 (PAL), Atari, 1978


The Atari 2600 is a video game console released in October 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and cartridges containing game code, instead of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware with all games built in. The first game console to use this format was the Fairchild Channel F; however, the Atari 2600 receives credit for making the plug-in concept popular among the game-playing public. The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200, in 1982, the VCS was renamed "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a cartridge game—initially Combat and later Pac-Man. The Atari 2600 was wildly successful, and during much of the 1980s, "Atari" was a synonym for this model in mainstream media and, by extension, for video games in general. In 2009, the Atari 2600 was named the second greatest video game console of all time by IGN (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600).

Amiga 3000, Commodore Business Machines, 1990


The Commodore Amiga 3000 was the third major release in the Amiga computer family. Released in June 1990, it featured improved processing speed, better rendering of graphics, and a new revision of the operating system. Its predecessors, the Amiga 500, 1000 and 2000, shared the same fundamental system architecture and consequently performed without much variation in processing speed despite considerable variation in purchase price. The A3000 however, was entirely reworked and rethought as a high-end workstation. The new Motorola 32-bit 68030 CPU, 68882 math co-processor, and 32-bit system memory helped increase the "integer" processing speed by a factor of 5 to 18, and the "floating point" processing speed by a factor of 7 to 200 times. The new 32-bit Zorro III expansion slots provided for faster and more powerful expansion capabilities. In common with earlier Amigas it ran a 32-bit operating system, but the "Workbench 2.04" revision resulted in a more ergonomic and attractive interface and access for programmers was simplified. Additionally, Commodore had a licensing agreement with AT&T to include a port of Unix System V (release 4), which was available with the Amiga 3000UX (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_3000).

Archimedes 310, Acorn, 1988


The Archimedes was the first RISC home computer. There were three series, the 300, 400 and 500 which shared the same hardware basis: the ARM-2 processor (ARM-3 for the A500) and three custom chips dedicated to memory (MEMC), video (VIDC) and I/O (IOC) controls. The ARM 2 RISC (8Mhz) had about 4 Mips, this means seven times faster than a Amiga 500 (68000 CPU)! The 300 series had 512 KB to 1 MB of memory and two expansion slots (64 pin). The 400 series had 1 to 4 MB of memory and four slots (three 64 pin and one 96 pin) (source: http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=75).

It offered high graphic resolution, lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then ! The two models had same characteristics, the 400 is the low-cost version, it has only 16 KB (instead of 48 KB), one cartridge port (two for the 800) and a membrane keyboard (a typewriter style keyboard one for the 800) (source: http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76).

Amiga 500 (NTSC, OCS), Commodore Business Machines, 1987


The Amiga 500 - also known as the A500 (or its code name 'Rock Lobster') - was the first “low-end” Commodore Amiga 16/32-bit multimedia home/personal computer. It was announced at the winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1987 - at the same time as the high-end Amiga 2000 - and competed directly against the Atari 520ST. Before Amiga 500 was shipped, Commodore suggested that the list price of the Amiga 500 was 595.95 USD without a monitor. At delivery in 1987, Commodore announced that the Amiga 500 would carry a 699 USD list price. The Amiga 500 represented a return to Commodore's roots by being sold in the same mass retail outlets as the Commodore 64 - to which it was a spiritual successor - as opposed to the computer-store-only Amiga 1000. The original Amiga 500 proved to be Commodore’s best-selling Amiga model, enjoying particular success in Europe.[1] Although popular with hobbyists, arguably its most widespread use was as a gaming machine, where its advanced graphics and sound for the time were of significant benefit (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500).

You can select to have either mouse or joystick attached to the ports through the dipswitches. The Amiga detects external drives by querying them. Right now, only drives are added to the the system which have an image in them. There is still no keyboard emulation. This version supports many more gfx modes, sprites, input modes, etc and compatibility with many software has increased. Rewrote large portions of the floppy controller. More games should load properly now. Moved things around using banks, wHich decreased the overall memory requeriments for the driver from 16 megs to 2 megs. Removed the extra 'chip' and 'extended' ram from the default configuration. The current memory setup should be the same as a stock A500 [Ernesto Corvi].

Atari 5200, Atari, 1982


The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, or simply the Atari 5200, is a video game console that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc. as a higher end complementary console for the popular Atari 2600. The 5200 was created to compete with the Intellivision, but wound up more directly competing with the ColecoVision shortly after its release. The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s existing 400/800 computers and the internal hardware was almost identical, although software was not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers feature an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, pause and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the four-position joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600. In August 2009, video game website IGN placed the 5200 23rd out of the 25 greatest video game consoles of all time (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_5200).

Atari 7800 (NTSC), Atari, 1986


The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a video game console re-released by Atari Corporation in January 1986. The original release had occurred two years earlier under Atari Inc. The 7800 had originally been designed to replace Atari Inc.'s Atari 5200 in 1984, but was temporarily shelved due to the sale of the company after the video game crash. In January 1986, the 7800 was again released and would compete that year with the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System. It had simple digital joysticks; it was almost fully backward-compatible with the Atari 2600; and it was considered affordable at a price of US$140 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_7800).

Atari 7800 (PAL), Atari, 1986


The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a video game console re-released by Atari Corporation in January 1986. The original release had occurred two years earlier under Atari Inc. The 7800 had originally been designed to replace Atari Inc.'s Atari 5200 in 1984, but was temporarily shelved due to the sale of the company after the video game crash. In January 1986, the 7800 was again released and would compete that year with the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System. It had simple digital joysticks; it was almost fully backward-compatible with the Atari 2600; and it was considered affordable at a price of US$140 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_7800).

Atari 800 (NTSC), Atari, 1979


The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers manufactured from 1979 to 1992. All are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU and were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips. Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the original Atari 400 and 800 and their successors, the XL and XE series of computers. Overall, the Atari 8-bit computer line was a commercial success, selling two million units through its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_800).

ABC 1600 was a personal computer from Luxor that was introduced in 1985. The model was built around the Motorola 68008 processor, had 1 megabyte of memory and used the operating system ABCenix, a Unix-like system developed from DNIX. ABC 1600 used monochrome graphics with the display resolution of 1024 × 768 and the screen could be turned 90° while in use depending on whether the user desired to work in standing (portrait) or horizontal (landscape) format. The hard disk could store 13 MB and the 5.25-inch floppy disk drive stored 640kB (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_1600).

ABC 80, Luxor Datorer AB, 1978


The ABC 80 (Advanced BASIC Computer 80) was a home computer engineered by the Swedish corporation Dataindustrier AB (DIAB) and manufactured by Luxor in Motala, Sweden in the late 1970s (first model August 1978) and early 1980s. It was based on the Zilog Z80 running at 3 MHz and had 16 kB RAM, expandable to 32 kB, and 16 kB ROM containing a fast semi-compiling BASIC interpreter. ABC 80 normally used a dedicated (included) tape recorder for program and data storage, but could also be expanded to handle disk drives (and many other peripherals). Some sound effects could be produced by a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip which was connected to an 8-bit output port, but there was no way to control the chip's features in any detail, so sound was limited to 96 fixed sounds. The monitor was a black and white TV set modified for the purpose (an obvious choice since Luxor also made TVs). The computer had excellent I/O response times, something that was discovered when trying to upgrade to Personal computer. The solution was to use a microcontroller that communicated with a PC. The main unit had a reset button as well (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_80).

ABC 800 C/HR, Luxor Datorer AB, 1981


The Luxor ABC 800 series are office-versions of the ABC 80 home computer. They featured an enhanced BASIC interpreter, a slightly faster clocked CPU and more memory: 32 kilolobytes RAM and 32 kB ROM was now standard, the Z80 is clocked at 3.58 MHz (using an NTSC color subcarrier crystal). It featured 40 x 24 text mode with 8 colors (ABC 800 C) or 80 x 24 text mode monochrome (ABC 800 M). They could also be extended with "high" resolution graphics (240 x 240 pixels, 2 bpp) using 16 kB RAM as video memory. The ABC 800 came in a monochrome version with amber text on brown background with an 80 character wide screen, and a color version with 40 characters. The main board is integrated with the keyboard much like the Amiga 500. However the ABC computers has a very sturdy metal chassis. Storage is usually two 5.25" floppy disk units in 160, 320 or 640 kB capacity. External hard disk systems became available later (primarily the ABC 850 with 10 MB). Model numbers 'ABC 800 M' for monochrome and 'ABC 800 C' for color (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_800).

0.132 [R. Belmont, Fabio Priuli]


Neo-Geo AES, SNK, 1990


The Neo Geo is a cartridge-based arcade and home video game system released on July 1, 1991 by Japanese game company SNK. Being in the Fourth generation of Gaming, it was the first console in the former Neo Geo family, which only lived through the 1990s. The hardware featured comparatively colourful 2D graphics. The MVS (Multi Video System), as the Neo Geo was known to the coin-op industry, offered arcade operators the ability to put up to 6 different arcade titles into a single cabinet, a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game-cabinet could be exchanged for a different game-title by swapping the game's ROM-cartridge and cabinet artwork. Several popular franchise-series, including Fatal Fury, The King of Fighters, Metal Slug and Samurai Shodown, were released for the platform. The Neo Geo system was also marketed as a very costly home console, commonly referred to today as the AES (Advanced Entertainment System). The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit, though it was technically a parallel processing 16-bit system with an 8-bit Zilog Z80 as coprocessor. The coprocessor was used as a CPU, and for sound processing. The Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis also had similar co-processors, with neither Sega nor Nintendo claiming they were 24-bit. The Neo Geo was ranked 19th out of the 25 best video game consoles of all time by the video game website IGN in 2009.

Apple I, Apple Computer, 1976


The Apple I, also known as the Apple-1, is a personal computer released by Apple in 1976. They were designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW van. It was demonstrated in April 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I)

Apple ][, Apple Computer, 1977

The Apple II series is a set of 8-bit home computers, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak, manufactured by Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) and introduced in 1977 with the original Apple II. In terms of ease of use, features and expandability the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the Apple I, a limited-production bare circuit board computer for electronics hobbyists that pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire in 1977, the Apple II was among the first successful personal computers; it launched the Apple company into a successful business (and allowed several related companies to start). Throughout the years, a number of models were sold, with the most popular model remaining relatively little changed into the 1990s. By the end of production in 1993, somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers (including about 1.25 million Apple IIGS models) had been produced. The Apple II became one of the most recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular VisiCalc spreadsheet, made the computer especially popular with business users and families. The original Apple II operating system was contained in ROM along with Integer BASIC. Programs were entered, then saved and loaded on cassette tape. When the Disk II was implemented in 1978 by Steve Wozniak, a Disk Operating System or DOS was commissioned. The final and most popular version of this software was Apple DOS 3.3. Some commercial Apple II software booted directly and did not use standard DOS formats. This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed. Apple DOS was superseded by ProDOS, which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party Z80-based expansion card[6] the Apple II could boot into the CP/M operating system and run WordStar, dBase II, and other CP/M software. At the height of its evolution, towards the late 1980s, the platform had the graphical look of a hybrid of the Apple II and Macintosh with the introduction of the Apple IIGS. By 1992, the platform had 16-bit processing capabilities, a mouse-driven Graphical User Interface, and graphics and sound capabilities far beyond the original. Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based Apple Lisa system in 1983, and its more successful cousin the Macintosh in 1984, the relatively unsophisticated Apple II series was Apple's primary revenue source for most of the following decade. At its peak, it was a billion-dollar-a-year industry with its associated community of third-party developers and retailers. The Apple IIGS was sold until the end of 1992; the last II-series Apple in production, the IIe, was discontinued on October 15, 1993 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_2).

Apple //c, Apple Computer, 1984


The Apple IIc, the fourth model in the Apple II series of personal computers, was Apple Computer’s first endeavor to produce a portable computer. The end result was a 7.5 lb (3.4 kg) notebook-sized version of the Apple II that could be transported from place to place. The c in the name stood for compact, referring to the fact it was essentially a complete Apple II computer setup (minus display and power supply) squeezed into a small notebook-sized housing. While sporting a built-in floppy drive and new rear peripheral expansion ports integrated onto the main logic board, it lacked the internal expansion slots and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple IIs, making it a closed system like the Macintosh. However, that was the intended direction for this model — a more appliance-like machine, ready to use out of the box, requiring no technical know-how or experience to hook up and therefore attractive to first-time users (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIc).

Apple //c (UniDisk 3.5), Apple Computer, 1985


This update, introduced in November 1985, came in the form of an upgrade to the ROM firmware which doubled in size from 16 KB to 32 KB. The new ROM supported “intelligent” devices such as the Apple UniDisk 3.5-inch (800 KB) floppy drive, in addition to an external 5.25-inch floppy drive. A new self-test diagnostic was provided for testing built-in RAM and other signs of logic faults. The Mini-Assembler, absent since the days of the Apple II Plus, made a return, and new Monitor “Step” and “Trace” commands were added as well. The upgraded ROM added rudimentary support for an external AppleTalk networking device which was yet to be developed. When attempting to boot virtual slot 7, users would encounter the message “APPLETALK OFFLINE.” The IIc, however, had no built-in networking capabilities, and no external device was ever released. The upgrade consisted of a single chip swap (and a trivial motherboard modification), which Apple provided free only to persons who purchased a UniDisk 3.5 drive. A small sticker with an icon of a 3.5-inch floppy diskette was placed next to the existing 5.25-inch diskette icon above the floppy drive port indicating the machine had been upgraded.

Apple //c Plus, Apple Computer, 1988


The Apple IIc Plus is the sixth and final model in the Apple II line of personal computers, produced by Apple Computer. The "Plus" in the name was a reference to the additional features it offered over the original portable Apple IIc, such as greater storage capacity (a built-in 3.5-inch floppy drive replacing the classic 5.25-inch), increased processing speed, and a general standardization of the system components. In a notable change of direction, the Apple IIc Plus, for the most part, did not introduce new technology or any further evolutionary contributions to the Apple II series, instead merely integrating existing peripherals into the original Apple IIc design. The development of the 8-bit machine was criticized by quarters more interested in the significantly more advanced 16-bit Apple IIGS.

The Apple IIe is the third model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The e in the name stands for enhanced, referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were only available as upgrades and add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes

Apple //e (enhanced), Apple Computer, 1985


In March 1985, Apple replaced the original machine with a new revision called the Enhanced IIe. It is completely identical to the previous machine except for 4 chips changed on the motherboard (and a small "Enhanced" or "65C02" sticker placed over the keyboard power indicator). The purpose of the update was to make the Apple IIe more compatible with the Apple IIc (released the previous year) and in some respects to a smaller degree, the Apple II Plus. This change involved a new processor, the CMOS based 65C02 CPU, a new character ROM for the text modes, and two new ROM firmware chips. The 65C02 added more CPU instructions, the new character ROM added 32 special "MouseText" characters (which allowed the creation of a GUI-like display in text mode, similar to IBM code page 437), and the new ROM firmware fixed problems and speed issues with 80 columns text, introduced the ability to use lowercase in Applesoft BASIC and Monitor, and contained some other smaller improvements (and fixes) in the latter two (including the return of the Mini-Assembler—which had vanished with the introduction of the II Plus firmware). Although it affected compatibility with a small number of software titles (particularly those that did not follow Apple programming guidelines and rules, used illegal opcodes that were no longer available in the new CPU, or used the alternate 80-column character set that MouseText now occupied) a fair bit of newer software — mostly productivity applications and utilities — required the Enhancement chipset to run at all. An official upgrade kit, consisting of these four replacement chips and an "Enhanced" sticker badge, was made available for purchase to owners of the original Apple IIe. An alternative at the time, which some users choose as a cost cutting measure, was to simply purchase their own 65C02 CPU and create (unlicensed and illegal) duplicates of the updated ROMs using re-rewritable EPROM chips. When Apple phased out the Enhancement kit in the early 1990s, this became the only available method for users looking to upgrade their IIe, and remains so right up until present day. An Enhanced machine identifies itself with the name "Apple //e" on its start up splash screen (as opposed to the less specific "Apple ][").

Apple //e (Platinum), Apple Computer, 1987


In January 1987 came the final revision of the Apple IIe, often referred to as the Platinum IIe, due to the color change of its case to the light-grey color scheme that Apple dubbed "Platinum". Changes to this revision were mostly cosmetic to modernize the look of the machine. Besides the color change, there was a new keyboard layout with built-in numeric keypad. The keyboard was changed to match the layout of the Apple IIGS, with the reset key moved above the ESC and '1' keys, the Open and Solid Apple modifier keys replaced by Command and Option and the power LED relocated above the numeric keypad. Gone were the recessed metal ID badges (showing the Apple logo and name, with "//e" beside it) replaced with a simpler "Apple IIe" silk screened on the case lid in the Apple Garamond font. A smaller Apple logo badge remained, which was moved to the right side of the case. Internally, a (reduced in size) Extended 80 Columns Card was factory pre-installed, making it come standard with 128 KB RAM and Double-Hi-Res graphics enabled. The motherboard has a reduced chip count by merging the two system ROM chips into one and used higher density memory chips so its 64 KB RAM could be made up of two (64 Kbx4) chips rather than eight (64 Kbx1) chips, bringing the count down to a total of 24 chips. A solder pad location on the motherboard, present since the original IIe, for (optionally) making presses of the "Shift" keys detectable in software, is now shorted by default so that the feature is always active. Next, in a move to reduce Radio Frequency Interference when a joystick plugs into the motherboard's Game I/O socket, filtering capacitors were added. While this made no difference to the average user, it had the negative effect of lowering the available bandwidth to the socket, which is often used by specialized devices for such purposes as measuring temperature, controlling a robotic device, or even simplistic networking for data transfer to another computer. In such cases the specialized devices were rendered useless on the Platinum IIe unless the user removed the capacitors from the board. There were no firmware changes present, and functionally the motherboard is otherwise identical to the Enhanced IIe. This final model of the Apple IIe was discontinued in November 1993, officially retiring the entire Apple II family line with it

Apple IIgs (ROM03), Apple Computer, 1989


The Apple IIGS, the fifth and most powerful model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The "GS" in the name stands for Graphics and Sound, referring to its enhanced graphics and sound capabilities, both of which greatly surpassed previous models of the line. At the time of its release, while it featured graphics comparable to other advanced home computers of the era (even more advanced than the black and white Macintosh, apart from a lower vertical resolution), it was most notable for its then state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis which surpassed all other personal computers at the time. The machine was a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its true 16-bit architecture, increased processing speed, direct access to megabytes of RAM, wavetable music synthesizer, graphical user interface, and mouse. While still maintaining full backwards compatibility with earlier Apple II models, it blended the Apple II and aspects of Macintosh technology into one. Keeping with Apple's "Apple II Forever" slogan of the time, the IIgs set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple paid it relatively little attention as the company increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform. The Apple IIgs was the first computer produced by Apple to use a color graphical user interface, as well as the "Platinum" (light grey) color scheme and the Apple Desktop Bus interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices. It was also the first personal computer to come with a built-in "wavetable" sample-based synthesizer chip, utilizing technology from Ensoniq. The machine outsold all other Apple products, including the Macintosh, during its first year in production.

Apple ][j+, Apple Computer, 1980


The Apple II Plus had a total of 48 KB of RAM, expandable to 64 KB by means of the Language Card, an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support a maximum of 64 KB of address space, and a machine with 48KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12 KB of read-only memory and 4 KB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The Language Card was also required to use LOGO, Apple Pascal, and FORTRAN 77. Apple Pascal and FORTRAN ran under a non-DOS operating system based on UCSD P-System, which had its own disk format and included a "virtual machine" that allowed it to run on many different types of hardware.

Apple ///, Apple Computer, 1980


The Apple III (often rendered as Apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer produced and released by Apple Computer that was intended as the successor to the Apple II series, but largely considered a failure in the market. Development work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of "Sara", named after Sander's daughter. The machine was first announced and released on May 19, 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced the following autumn. Development stopped and the Apple III was discontinued on April 24, 1984, and the III Plus was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985. The Apple III could be viewed as an enhanced Apple II – then the newest heir to a line of 8-bit machines dating back to 1976. Officially, however, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. In 1981, International Business Machines unveiled the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) – a completely new 16-bit design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the PC-DOS/MS-DOS platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line. Despite numerous stability issues and recalls, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable and dependable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000–75,000 Apple III computers were sold. The Apple III Plus brought this up to ~120,000. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects. The Apple III's failure led to Apple reevaluating their plan to phase out the Apple II and eventually continued on with its development. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware[citation needed] and software technologies of the Apple III.

Apricot PC, ACT, 1983


The Apricot PC was Apricot Computers' first personal computer made for business use. The press received it well, especially for the high resolution 800 x 400 of its time and its trackball cable (future models will be IR). It is the first non-Japanese computer using 3.5" Sony floppy disc units. It uses a Intel 8086 processor running at 4,77 MHz. Optional 8087 math co-processor were possible. Memory is 256 kB expandable to 768 kB. CRT green-screen 9"[1] with text mode 80 x 25 or graphics 800 x 400 pixels. Equipped with two floppy discs and a keyboard with an integrated LCD display. Released in 1983, it achieved success in the UK. The manufacturer failed completely to clone the IBM BIOS, so although it ran MS-DOS and CP/M-86, it was not IBM PC compatible as the underlying system BIOS and hardware is very different. An Intel 8089 I/O controller was used, instead of the Intel 8237 DMA chip used in IBM computers; the ROM was only a simple boot loader rather than a full BIOS; and there was no 640k barrier. The floppy disk format was "not quite compatible"; attempting to read an ordinary PC floppy in an Apricot, or vice versa, would result in a scrambled directory listing with some files missing. Apricot later offered the possibility of converting the computer into an IBM compatible PC by replacing the motherboard with one equipped with an Intel 80286 processor (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot_PC).

Apricot VX FT server, Apricot, 1989


In 1989, a cover story by Byte magazine announced the Apricot VX FT Server as the world's first machine to incorporate the intel 486 micro processor[1]. This machine, designed by Bob Cross, was a fault tolerant file server based on Micro Channel architecture, incorporating an external RAM cache and its own UPS. The VX FT line consisted of Series 400 and Series 800, with four different models each. These (and their other systems) were manufactured in their state of the art factory in Glenrothes, Fife, Scotland (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot_Computers#1980s).

Apricot XEN PC (A1 Motherboard), Apricot, 1993


The last Apricot computer not to be IBM compatible was the XEN (October 1985), a 286-based system intended to compete with the IBM AT and running Windows 1.0. It was superseded in 1986 by the XEN-i, the first in a line of IBM compatible systems. The Xen-i initially shipped with a 5.25" floppy drive to further improve its IBM compatible credentials. The 3.5" drive made a reappearance when IBM themselves switched formats with the release of the PS/2 range (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot_Computers).

The Arcadia 2001 is a second-generation 8-bit console released by Emerson Radio Corp. The game library was composed of 51 unique games and about 10 variations. The graphic quality is similar to that of the Intellivision and the Odyssey². The Arcadia was not named after the company of the same name. Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the 2600 supercharger, was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to Starpath.[2] Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 worldwide, and over 30 Arcadia clones exist.

The Astrocade is an early video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway, the videogame division of Bally. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1983. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities.

Bally Home Library Computer, Bally Manufacturing, 1977


Originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer, it was released in 1977 but available only through mail order. Delays in the production meant none of the units actually shipped until 1978, and by this time the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade. In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure (unlike the Atari VCS). In 1979 Bally grew less interested in the arcade market and decided to sell off their Consumer Products Division, including development and production of the game console.

The name AT stood for "Advanced Technology", and was chosen because the AT offered various technologies that were then new in personal computers; one such advancement was that the 80286 processor supported protected mode. IBM later released an 8 MHz version of the AT.

B128 (60Hz), Commodore Business Machines, 1983


The Commodore B128-80 (at one time, called the C128-80), was to be the successor to the popular Commodore PET system. The "B" is for "business", of course, as this was Commodore's attempt to enter the market with a serious and powerful computer system which could compete with the other popular units of the time. There were other similar "B Series" models, some with built-in floppy drives, and even a swivel monitor attached to the top. All of the current Commodore peripherals could be used with the "B Series", this includes cassette data recorders, floppy drives, and printers. The B128-80 computer shown here is the most common, probably because it was the cheapest (source: http://oldcomputers.net/b128.html).

BeBox Dual603-66, Be Inc, 1995


The BeBox was a short-lived dual processor personal computer, offered by Be Inc. to run the company's own operating system, BeOS. Notable aspects of the system include its CPU configuration, I/O board with "GeekPort", and "Blinkenlights" on the front bezel. The BeBox made its debut in October 1995 (BeBox Dual603-66). The processors were upgraded to 133 MHz in August 1996 (BeBox Dual603e-133). Production was halted in January 1997[1], following the port of BeOS to the Macintosh, in order for the company to concentrate on software. Be sold around 1000 66 MHz BeBoxes and 800 133 MHz BeBoxes (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeBox).

Basic Master Level 3, Hitachi, 1980


This japanese computer seems quite powerful. The main board is located into the main case, under the monitor. Inside this main case there are 6 expansion slots which is quite enough ! Thus a lot of expansion boards were available (disk, printers, 8088, Z80 boards, etc). An interesting feature is that there's a little trap-door on the keyboard which reveals some cool control switches : a power switch, a text mode switch (80 / 40 columns), a reset button and volume control knob (source: http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=2).

- 0.142u4: Added cartridge softlist and connected it to the driver [Curt Coder].

- 0.137: Connected Commodore 1551 floppy drive [Curt Coder].

- 0.135: Fixed graphical corruptions in multisession runs (bug #1387) [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.128: Fixed behavior of Joystick Ports Swapping: if you press F1 in partial keyboard emulation, Joy1 keys will go to Joy2 port (as if you had plugged your joystick in port 2). This helps with games which expect joystick inputs from port 2 of the C16. Added support for tape emulation using MESS core functions (only loading, both .wav and .tap formats). Refactored cartridge code to rely on MESS core functions. As a result carts are now working. Also removed -cart2 device, since C16 / C116 / Plus4 had only a single cartridge port [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.126: Large clean-up of input ports across Commodore machines (Amiga excluded) [Fabio Priuli]:

  * created machine/cbmipt.c to reduce duplicate code across drivers and hidden dependencies;

  * converted to tagged inputs;

  * added partial natural keyboard support (keys are almost all there, but there are still a few issues);

  * replaced a lot of constants with direct reads to tagged inputs, cleaning up most of the Commodore files in includes/ ;

  * simplified interrupt handling for c64 and c16;

  * fixed pet.c machines which were starting Caps Lock'ed;

  * propagated ':/;' fixes (from rev. 2542) to all the drivers with the same error;

  * removed some dead code for cart handling (never fully implemented and obsolete after rev. 2421);

  * removed hacked SID from c16;

  * fixed key mappings to follow the real keyboard (also added plus4 input ports for this same reason);

  * documented keyboard layouts.

- 0.125: Simplified keyboard and interrupt handling code [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.112: Fixed crash when ramsize was set to less than 64k (bug #1049) [Nate Woods].

- 0.102: Implemented RAM configuration support [Nate Woods].

- 0.86: Fixed a regression in which certain input ports were being ignored. This was caused by a defect in PORT_INCLUDE [Nate Woods].

- 0.85: Added natural keyboard support [Nate Woods].

- 0.67: Improved TED7360 sound emulation [Attila Grosz]. Fixed crashes in quickloader [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b15: Tape fixed; TED timer 1 reloading on underrun changed. [PeT] ECM and Multicolor mode: cursor and character inversion disabled. TED sound channels simplified to generate only rectangular signals: digisound working, less static, clearer sound. Now the driver uses MOS 8580. SID cleanup, realtime modifications, digisound support (fx sound good now, random number generation ok) [PeT].

- 0.37b7: Added SIDCARD support at address $d400 [Peter Trauner].

- 0.37b3: Emulated flashing mode of the TED chip, activated and fixed blinking. Disabled blinking in multicolor modes (winter edition) [Peter Trauner].

- 0.37b2: cbmdrive (memory freeing) fixed, cia6526 tod fix, c128fra fix, 50 hertz machines now really have 50 hz video refresh, c16 1551 simulation fixed [Peter Trauner].

Commodore 64 (NTSC), Commodore Business Machines, 1982


The Commodore 64 is an 8-bit home computer introduced by Commodore International in January 1982. Volume production started in the spring of 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US $595. Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET machines, the C64 features 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM, hence the name, and had favourable sound and graphical specifications when compared to well known contemporary systems such as the Apple II, particularly as the price was well below that demanded by Apple. It is commonly known as the C64 or C=64 (after the graphic logo on the case) and occasionally as the CBM 64 (for Commodore Business Machines), or VIC-64. It has also been nicknamed the "breadbox" and "bullnose" due to the shape and color of its initial casing. During the C64's lifetime, sales totalled between 12.5 and 17 million units, making it the best-selling single personal computer model of all time. For a substantial period of time (1983-1986), the C64 dominated the market with between 30% and 40% share and 2 million units sold per year, outselling the IBM PC clones, Apple Inc. computers, and Atari 8-bit family computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview "When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years." Part of its success was because it was sold in retail stores instead of electronics stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control supplies and cost. It is sometimes compared to the Ford Model-T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles were made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularizing the computer demo scene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists.

Commodore 64C (NTSC), Commodore Business Machines, 1986


The Commodore 64 is an 8-bit home computer introduced by Commodore International in January 1982. Volume production started in the spring of 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US $595. Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET machines, the C64 features 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM, hence the name, and had favourable sound and graphical specifications when compared to well known contemporary systems such as the Apple II, particularly as the price was well below that demanded by Apple. It is commonly known as the C64 or C=64 (after the graphic logo on the case) and occasionally as the CBM 64 (for Commodore Business Machines), or VIC-64. It has also been nicknamed the "breadbox" and "bullnose" due to the shape and color of its initial casing. During the C64's lifetime, sales totalled between 12.5 and 17 million units, making it the best-selling single personal computer model of all time. For a substantial period of time (1983-1986), the C64 dominated the market with between 30% and 40% share and 2 million units sold per year, outselling the IBM PC clones, Apple Inc. computers, and Atari 8-bit family computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview "When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years." Part of its success was because it was sold in retail stores instead of electronics stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control supplies and cost. It is sometimes compared to the Ford Model-T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles were made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularizing the computer demo scene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists.

Commodore 64C (PAL), Commodore Business Machines, 1986


In 1986, Commodore released the Commodore 64C (C64C) computer, which was functionally identical to the original, but whose exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the Commodore 128 and other contemporary design trends. The modifications to the C64 line were more than skin deep in the C64C with new versions of the SID, VIC and I/O chips being deployed—with the core voltage reduced from 12 V to 9 V. In the United States, the C64C was often bundled with the third-party GEOS GUI-based operating system. The Commodore 1541 disk drive received a matching face-lift resulting in the 1541c. Later a smaller, sleeker 1541-II model was introduced along with the 800 KB 3.5-inch microfloppy 1581.

Commodore 64 Direct-to-TV (Version 2 050711), The Toy:Lobster Company, 2005


In the middle of 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer Tulip Computers BV (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the C64 Direct-to-TV (C64DTV), a joystick-based TV game based on the C64 with 30 games built into ROM. Designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern C-One C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the Atari 2600 and Intellivision which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on QVC in the United States for the 2004 holiday season. Some users have installed 1541 floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks and keyboards to these units, which give the DTV devices nearly all of the capabilities of a full Commodore 64. The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console/game Hummer, sold at RadioShack mid-2005.

Commodore 64DX Development System (Prototype, PAL, German), Commodore Business
Machines, 1991

In 1990, an advanced successor to the C64, the Commodore 65 (also known as the "C64DX"), was prototyped, but the project was canceled by Commodore's chairman Irving Gould in 1991. The C65's specifications were very good for an 8-bit computer. For example, it could display 256 colors on screen, while OCS based Amigas could only display 64 in HalfBrite mode (32 colors and half-bright transformations); the HAM mode on the Amiga allowed all 4096 colors of the 12 bit color system, but it was awkward to use and had restrictions on color combinations between adjacent pixels. Although no specific reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it would have competed in the marketplace with Commodore's lower end Amigas and the CDTV.

Commodore 64 Games System (PAL), Commodore Business Machines, 1990


n 1990, the C64 was re-released in the form of a game console, called the C64 Games System (C64GS). A simple modification to the C64C's motherboard was made to orient the cartridge connector to a vertical position. This allowed cartridges to be inserted from above. A modified ROM replaced the BASIC interpreter with a boot screen to inform the user to insert a cartridge. It was designed to rival the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System but it suffered from very low sales compared to its rivals and it was another commercial failure for Commodore, and it was never released outside of Europe.

Commodore 65 Development System (Prototype, NTSC), Commodore Business Machines, 1991


The Commodore 65 (also known as the C64DX, not to be confused with the Commodore SX-64 portable unit) was a prototype computer created by Fred Bowen and others at Commodore Business Machines (CBM) (part of Commodore International) in 1990–91. The project was cancelled by CEO Irving Gould. The C65 was an improved version of the Commodore 64, and it was meant to be backwards-compatible with the older computer, while still providing a number of advanced features close to those of the Amiga. When Commodore International was liquidated in 1994, a number of prototypes were sold on the open market, and thus a few people actually own a Commodore 65. Estimates as to the actual number of machines found on the open market range from 50 to 2000 units. As the C65 project was cancelled, the final 8-bit offering from CBM remained the triple-mode, 1–2 MHz, 128 kB (expandable), C64-compatible Commodore 128 of 1985.

FM-Towns Car Marty, Fujitsu, 1994


The FM Towns Marty was a fifth-generation video game console released in 1993 by Fujitsu, exclusively for the Japanese market. It was the first 32-bit home video game system, and came complete with a built in CD-ROM drive and disk drive. It was based on the earlier FM Towns computer system Fujitsu had released in 1989. The Marty was backward-compatible with older FM Towns games. In 1994 a new version of the console called the FM Towns Marty 2 was released. It featured a darker gray shell and a new lower price (66,000 yen) but was otherwise identical to the first Marty. It is widely believed that the FM Towns Marty 2 would feature similar improvements to the FM Towns 2, which had a swifter CPU than the first, but this is not the case.[1] It has also been speculated that the Marty 2 featured a 486 CPU, however this was also discovered to be false. As well as this, there is also the FM Towns Car Marty for installation in automobiles. This came in two versions, the MVP-1 (released in April 1994) and MVP-10 (released in November 1994). The only difference between the MVP-1 and MVP-10 is the drive mechanisms. There has been speculation that the MVP-10 was introduced since the MVP-1 broke easily. An additional accessory that was available to FM Towns Car Marty owners included a GPS, subsequently sold with a video monitor.

Released in October 1995, it was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to female gamers. Only 10 games were released for it, most being in the otome games and dress-up genres. An interesting feature of this machine was that it included a built-in thermal color printer that could be used to create stickers from game screenshots. An optional accessory, called Magical Shop, allowed the machine to be used with outside devices (such as VCRs and DVD players) to obtain images from them, add text, and make stickers from those as well. The machine features only one controller port.

0.1 [Juergen Buchmueller]

Colour Genie 2000, EACA Computers Ltd., 1982

The EACA EG2000 Colour Genie is a computer produced by Hong Kong-based manufacturer EACA. It followed their earlier Video Genie I and II computers and was released around the same time as the business-oriented Video Genie III. The BASIC is compatible with the Video Genie I and II and the TRS-80, except for graphic and sound commands; some routines for Video Genie I BASIC commands were left over in the Colour Genie's BASIC ROM. Programs were provided to load TRS-80 programs into the Colour Genie. Colour Genie disks could be read in a TRS-80 floppy disk drive but not vice versa. Unlike the earlier Video Genies, which were compatible with their main competitor (the Model I TRS-80), the Colour Genie is also incompatible with the rival TRS-80 Color Computer -- one fundamental difference being the different CPUs.

Color Computer, Tandy Radio Shack, 1980


The Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer (also marketed as the Tandy Color Computer and affectionately nicknamed CoCo) was a home computer launched in 1980. It was one of the earliest of the first generation of computers marketed for home use in English-speaking markets. While the model was eventually eclipsed by the onset of the IBM PC clones, enthusiasts have continued to affectionately tinker with the "CoCo" to the present day.

WIP:

- 08/12/2011 r13521: Apostrophe is fine in coco_cart.xml [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.144u1: Multiple VHD support [Nathan Woods].

- 14/11/2011 r13244: Removed HSI files not used and removed pce and sms referencing non existing extrainfo [Micko].

- 27/06/2011 r12082: Added Coco MultiPak support, for now FDC fixed on 4th slot and no way to change active cart [Micko].

- 26/06/2011 r12075: Coco cart devices rewritten to be slot devices, floppy still not finished so please do not make issues regarding this, will be done tomorrow [Micko].

- 0.142u5: Fixed floppy index pulse [Curt Coder]. Added cart softlist [K1W1].

- 29/05/2011 r11705: Made coco softlist works, now PAK is assumed default,since in case of softlist loading default is only first PCB, others can be mapped later with feature [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.135: Converted inputs to use PORT_CATEGORY (i.e. you now select controller type in the Categories submenu). When Joystick is selected in either Right or Left Controller Port, Hi-Res Interface becomes available in the Driver Configuration submenu [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.134: Added support for hi-res interface [Nathan Woods].

- 0.130: Cleanups. Fixed "Cartridge Auto-Start" setting (bug #1772). Added "unwired" (i.e. - can't connect to anything) support for the RS-232 PAK. This is merely a curiosity for now (bug #1772) [Nathan Woods].

- 0.129: Fixed Dragon Alpha, via MAME update, the NMI enable/disable allowing disks to boot again [Phill Harvey-Smith]. Minor cartridge loading code cleanups [Nathan Woods].

- 0.126: Changed MUX delay from 16us to 8us to fix a joystick input bug under [Nitr]OS-9. Since this delay was introduced to fix Photon (as per bug #655) and we've been unable to test Photon, it is unclear whether this reintroduces bug #655 (bug #1608) [Nate Woods].

- 0.125: Transitioned Bitbanger and VHD support to use MAME's core device system [Nate Woods].

- 0.124: Added a quickload for .BIN files. Fixed bug that could cause joystick button presses to not be registered (bug #1532) [Nate Woods].

- 0.121: Modified the CoCo's keyboard handler to pass along the tri-state buffer from port B to port A. Updated to use MAME's 6242 RTC implementation [tim lindner].

- 0.118: Fixed writing when extending the lengths of a VHD file (bug #1320). Fixed PIA regression that prevented OS-9 level 1 from working (bug #1314) [Nate Woods].

- 0.116: Cartridge slot rearchitecture [Nate Woods].

- 0.114: Fixed PIA misconfiguration (bug #1115); fixed Lightgun emulation; implemented MUX switching delay (bug #655) [tim lindner].

- 0.112: Fixed regression in one-bit sound (bug #1041). Fixed crash when ramsize was set to less than 32k (bug #993). Fixed hi-res interface regression introduced in 0.105.  Also cleaned up how input devices work (bug #1025) [Nate Woods].

- 0.111: Implemented Diecom Light Gun Adapter (bug #971) [Tim Lindner].

- 0.107: Fixed a subtle problem when creating DMK disk images (bug #864) [Nate Woods].

- 0.106: Changed joystick key assignments from arrow keys to numeric keypad, as well as added mouse button assignments. Complete rewrite of both M6847 and GIME video code; timing and performance enhancements. Fixed joystick regression introduced in 0.105 (bug #876) [Nate Woods].

- 0.99: Fixed a rounding error in cassette loading that affected the Dragon game "Screaming Abdabs" (bug #735) [Nate Woods].

- 0.97: Improved .CAS loading for images with odd block sequences [Phill Harvey-Smith].

- 0.96: Lengthened certain floppy disk controller operations; now NitrOS-9 boots on the CoCo 1/2 (bug #502) [Phill Harvey-Smith]. Fixed joystick ranges (they were previously 0-62 instead of 0-63.) bug #698) [Nate Woods].

- 0.92: Added support for The Rat graphics mouse (bug #639) [Tim Lindner].

- 0.90: Fixed a bug in DMK image creation that caused MESS and Imgtool to always zero count sectors when created (bug #630) [Nate Woods].

- 0.89: Fixed a regression that caused printer output to not work properly (bug #612) [Nate Woods].

- 0.88: Fixed a bug in DMK disk loading; games encoded with certain forms of copy protection now run (bug #606) [Tim Lindner].

- 0.85: Implemented .os9 disk image creation support (bug #576) [Nate Woods].

- 0.73: CoCo joystick buttons can now be mapped to the mouse buttons (bug #317) [Nate Woods].

- 0.70: Implemented cocodmk_sector_count() and cocodmk_sector_info() in coco_dsk.c, allowing DMK images with weird sector sizes to load properly (bug #378) [tim lindner].

- 0.68: PIA properly resets [Nate Woods].

- 0.67: Added direct support for OS-9 floppy disk images. If an attached disk's filename ends in .os9, the first sector will be analyzed for geometry information. Scaled the joystick port to 64 quanta rather than 256 (bug #340) [Tim Lindner]. Fixed bug #359. Added support for new GoodTools file extensions (bugs #277, #278, #279, #350) [Nate Woods].

- 0.62: Fixed some bugs related to handling of degenerate JVC files (where the file size is less than 161280 bytes) (bug #281) [Nate Woods].

- 0.61.1: Update CRC for bas10.rom. Previous dump was bad. I would like to send a pecial "Thank you" to Sellam Ismail (http://www.vintage.org) for finding a Color Computer that contained Color BASIC 1.0 [tim lindner]. Moved disk handling code over to new FormatDriver system; allowing transparent disk image handling for JVC, VDK, and DMK file formats. Fixed a recent stupid bug in m6847 timing that had an effect on certain timing situations (bug #249). Made sure that SAM (and GIME on the CoCo 3) registers are properly reset after a crash [Nate Woods].

- 0.61: Fixed a very ugly bug that could cause freezups under OS-9 and other forms of disk accesses. This was because interrupts were dropped when the CPU is halted. (Bugs #197, #229). The virtual printer should now be responsive to bitbanger output of any arbitrary baud [Nate Woods]. Fixed a OKI M6242B clock emulation problem and a problem with Disto Real Time Clock emulation [tim lindner].

- 0.56.1: Converted CoCo drivers to use configurable RAM sizes, and the CoCo 3 driver now supports the 2 MB upgrade (if I knew the specs, it would be very trivial for me to support the 8 MB upgrade). Fixed a bug in DMK disk image on little endian machines. (Bug #179) [Nate Woods].

- 0.56: Improved one bit sound out. Improved support for DMK file format; now supports multiple sector sizes. Fixed double sided disk access in OS-9. Added support for the memory sense switch used to select between 64/32, 16 and 4K [tim lindner].

- 0.37b15: Implemented support for the Orch90 cartridge [Tim Lindner]. Completely rewritten midframe video mode rendering, which now applies not just to the CoCo 3, but to all systems that use the m6847 and derivatives.  Also, a few effects now work that never have done before, including the dynamite effect in Canyon Climber and some SockMaster demos. Totally reworked ROM support; cartridge IO is now modular, the CART signal is handled better, and ROMs that don't take up the full address space are properly mirrored. These changes make many more cartridges work properly, including Mind-Roll which is banked.  Also, properly NOP'd invalid memory areas, which prevented Arkanoid from running [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b13: Added support for raw Program Pak dumps (use file extenion .ROM). Also, implemented the 1-bit sound mode. Basic save state support added [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b11: Reworked m6847 synchronization and sound mux signals to make them much more accurate. Fixed a bug that caused the joystick to max out all the time. Added a new abstraction layer for cartridge IO interfaces. Optimized graphics emulation a bit.  Adjusted default controls so that joystick buttons will work by default. Improved PMODE 4 artifact colors to be more accurate (special thanks to John Kowalski for providing color information) [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b9: Fixed the border colors when POKE 65314, [64-79;88-95] is invoked. [Nate Woods].

- 037b7: Updated CoCo drivers with new romsets to match the actual chips in the system. coco.rom split into bas12.rom, extbas11.rom and disk11.rom, and coco3.rom now must be of length 32768.  This requires a dump from an EPROM reader. Fixed a bug in cassette writing. Cassette tape controls and CoCo motor signal now operate independently  [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b5: Now using schedule_full_refresh() and PAK loader fixes applied [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b4: Now supports memory size SAM register, removed 2nd fire button from joysticks (only CoCo 3 has this). Video display now draws border [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b3: Better .CAS file support, now supports cassette writes, slightly better .PAK file support; now uses the standard wd179x code. As a result, src/mess/machine/cocodisk.c is not necessary anymore, implemented 63.5usec horizontal sync interrupt ()Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), implemented secondary fire buttons for both joysticks (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), keyboard interrupt (CoCo 3) [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b1: COCO/DRAGON now supports two distinct joysticks [Nate Woods].

- 0.36RC1: Added support for true lower case in lores text modes, and special characters in hires text modes for the CoCo 3 and added a "blur correction" mode for artifact colors in an attempt to make artifact colors be displayed more accurately.  Fixed a few CoCo III related bugs; most notably with PAK loading.  The CoCo driver will now recognize .PAK files that contain snapshot information (meaning that most .PAK files on the net will now work).  In addition, .PAK files are now loaded as IO_SNAPSHOT, rather than IO_CARTSLOT. Implemented the previously unimplemented graphics modes (G1C/G1R/G2C/G2R), enabled the fancy semigraphic modes; on the CoCo one could change the VDG as one mode but tell the SAM (synchronous address multiplexer) to feed data to the VDG as if a different video mode was done. This created the semigraphic modes that were used in games like Protector. Plot_pixel() is now used instead of assuming 8-bit bitmaps [Nate Woods].

- 0.36b16: PMODE 4 artifact colors in the CoCo drivers. The COCO had a black and white video mode that actually had two more colors in there that were created because the TV couldn't actually handle the high resolution. These colors would not appear on some monitors, and when they did appear, they would sometimes switch back and forth. Added a "dip switch" to the driver to control how these artifact colors are displayed, if at all [Nate Woods].

- 0.36b15: CoCo driver update, which includes the coco3 startup crash fix, and floppy disk bug fix in the Coco floopy disk code [Mathis Rosenhauer, Nate Woods].

- 0.36b12: Enabled the Disk Basic ROM (disk.rom) for the CoCo and CoCo 3 [Nathan].

- 0.36b7: Mathis Rosenhauer added Color Computer system.

Color Computer 3 (NTSC), Tandy Radio Shack, 1986


On July 30, 1986, Tandy announced the Color Computer 3 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. It came with 128K of RAM, which could be upgraded to 512K. The keyboard surround and cartridge door plastic were changed from black to grey. The keyboard layout was revised, putting the arrow keys in a diamond configuration and adding CTRL, ALT, F1 and F2 keys. It sold in Radio Shack stores and Tandy Computer Centers for $219.95. The CoCo 3 was compatible with most of the CoCo 2's peripherals. Most older software ran on it. Taking the place of the graphics and memory hardware in the CoCo 1 and 2 was an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the "GIME" (Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancement) chip. The GIME also provided additional features: Output to a composite video monitor or analog RGB monitor, in addition to the CoCo 1 and 2's TV output. This did much to improve the clarity of its output. A paged memory management unit which broke up the 6809's 64k address space into 8x8K chunks. Although these chunks were considered to be too large by many programmers, the scheme would later allow third party RAM upgrades of up to 2 MB (256x8k). Text display with real lowercase at 32, 40, 64, or 80 characters per line and between 16 and 24 lines per screen. Text character attributes, including 8 foreground and 8 background colors, underline, and blink. New graphics resolutions of 160, 256, 320 or 640 pixels wide by 192 to 225 lines. Up to 16 simultaneous colors out of a palette of 64 displayable at one time (unless programming tricks were employed to display more).

WIP:

- 04/12/2011 r13457: Fixed 8meg upgrade [Nate Woods].

- 0.139: Extended video to support 8MB of RAM (bug #1963) [Robert Gault].

- 0.137: Fixed broken Coco3 high-res timer emulation (bug #1913) [John W. Linville].

- 0.135: Converted inputs to use PORT_CATEGORY (i.e. you now select controller type in the Categories submenu). When Joystick is selected in either Right or Left Controller Port, Hi-Res Interface becomes available in the Driver Configuration submenu [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.130: Fixed Composite Monochrome bit (bug #1767) [Nathan Woods].

- 0.125: Transitioned Bitbanger and VHD support to use MAME's core device system [Nate Woods].

- 0.120: Fixed a regression in VHD handling (bug #1383) [Nate Woods].

- 0.118: Fixed bug in how the Coco 3 GIME performed a soft reset [Nate Woods].

- 0.113: Fixed a subtle GIME timer problem (bug #1065) [Nate Woods].

- 0.109: Fixed a bug that could cause hi-res text and graphics to not display properly when RGB is enabled (bug #938) [Nate Woods].

- 0.104: Fixed a timing bug in video rendering (bug #743) [Nate Woods].

- 0.101: Fixed assertion failure when using the zero/infinite scanlines video mode [Nate Woods].

- 0.90: Fixed a regression that prevented cartridges from loading on startup. Fixed a regression that prevented hires text blinking from updating properly (bug #628). [Nate Woods].

- 0.80: Video timing fixes and cleanups; certain SockMaster demos run better now. Also, fixed a bug that caused problems if a cartridge was ran and then the emulation was restarted without a cartridge in the same session. Fixed a minor video glitch due to not properly updating a value when bit 7 of $FF9F was changed (bug #359) [Nate Woods].

- 0.77: Fixed a bug in DMK handling (bug #454). Fixed a bug that caused Hi-Res graphic modes where the line pitch was less than 128 bytes to fail (bug #465) [Nate Woods].

- 0.73: Now supports option for 8MB of RAM [Nate Woods].

- 0.71: Added '_' to the supported keys for the natural keyboard.  '_' is specific to Nitr]OS-9. Fixed a bug whereby $FE00-$FEFF would be mapped to the wrong memory when bit 3 of $FF90 was set when more than 512k was available. This caused some NitrOS-9 programs to crash when allocating too much memory (bug #352) [Nate Woods].

- 0.66: Fixed a performance bug that could slow things down in simple cases where not much screen IO is being made [Nate Woods].

- 0.61.2: Fixed a bug that caused a few display glitches when switching between 40 column and 80 column mode. (bug #271) [Nate Woods].

- 0.61.1: Moved disk handling code over to new FormatDriver system; allowing transparent disk image handling for JVC, VDK, and DMK file formats. Fixed a palette timing bug that affected mid-frame video rendering (bug #253). Fixed a bug where hi-res text characters with the high bit set were rendered as garbage. Fixed a bug where $FF9D and associated registers were being updated before vblank, when they should have been updated after (bug #252). Made sure that SAM (and GIME on the CoCo 3) registers are properly reset after a crash [Nate Woods].

- 0.61: Exposed the two high bits on MMU registers (even though their value is undefined) to fix a problem with SockMaster's LSAVEM utility]. Fixed a bug in the GIME video emulation that caused all parts of the $FF9B/D/E video registers to be used in lo-res mode; where in reality the low 16 bits are dropped.  This caused a bug in CoCoTracker that caused the screen to be garbled after the MOD files are played [Nate Woods]. Adjusted composite colors slightly with help from SockMaster (Bug #227) [John Kowalski, Nate Woods].

- 0.56.1: Added support for Jeff Vavassour's virtual hard disk. His Color Computer 3 emulator comes with an OS-9 driver [tim lindner].

- 0.37b15: Completely rewritten midframe video mode rendering, which now applies not just to the CoCo 3, but to all systems that use the m6847 and derivatives.  Also, a few effects now work that never have done before, including the dynamite effect in Canyon Climber and some SockMaster demos. Totally reworked ROM support; cartridge IO is now modular, the CART signal is handled better, and ROMs that don't take up the full address space are properly mirrored. These changes make many more cartridges work properly, including Mind-Roll which is banked.  Also, properly NOP'd invalid memory areas, which prevented Arkanoid from running [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b13: Added support for raw Program Pak dumps (use file extenion .ROM). Also, implemented the 1-bit sound mode [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b12: More work on improving video timing for mid frame video register modification. Now supports mid frame palette modification, and altered the way video RAM is scanned so that John Kowalski's Boink demo now runs (albeit with many glitches). Also fixed a bug that would cause the "Speed Up Poke" to still be in effect after a reset [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b11: Reworked m6847 synchronization and sound mux signals to make them much more accurate. Fixed a bug that caused the joystick to max out all the time. Added a new abstraction layer for cartridge IO interfaces. Optimized graphics emulation a bit.  Adjusted default controls so that joystick buttons will work by default. Improved PMODE 4 artifact colors to be more accurate (special thanks to John Kowalski for providing color information) [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b10: Fixed the GIME Timer so that it isn't resetting on writes to $FF95 [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b9: Basics of mid-frame video mode changing made.  Crystal City runs a bit better, but some timing is still probably off.  Hi-res text will now display the underline in the proper place when the lines per row is not 8.  Lo-res font now skewed one scanline, as was the original machine. Fixed Composite Monitor colors; fixed the border colors when POKE 65314, [64-79;88-95] is invoked. [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b7: Updated CoCo 3 drivers with new romsets to match the actual chips in the system. coco.rom split into bas12.rom, extbas11.rom and disk11.rom, and coco3.rom now must be of length 32768.  This requires a dump from an EPROM reader. Fixed a bug in cassette writing.  Cassette tape controls and CoCo motor signal now operate independently  [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b6: Fixed low resolution video so that it is sensitive to the MMU; this fixes a problem that made OS-9 Level 2 display garbage. Also fixed two bugs that prevented horizontal scrolling from working properly [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b5: Fixed a bug the CoCo 3 horizontal scroll so Crystal City is partially playable now [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b4: Now supports LPR field on INIT1 GIME register when in graphics modes, fixed a bug that prevented video updates in hires 4-color modes. Fixed high speed timer to have the correct speed.  Subtle tweaks to interrupt handling. Special thanks to John Kowalski for info; now supports memory size SAM register, removed 2nd fire button from joysticks (only CoCo 3 has this). Video display now draws border [Nate Woods].

- 0.36RC2: Implemented several obscure video modes (CoCo 3), fixes a bug in flashing on hires text (CoCo 3), implemented the CoCo 3 timer, added several new additional key mappings so things like backspace work [Nate Woods].

- 0.36b16: CoCo 3 CMP/RGB color sets - the CoCo 3 had different color sets depending on whether a composite monitor/tv was used, or whether an RGB monitor was used. Now the CoCo 3 driver can emulate either display, and this is controlled from another dip switch [Nate Woods].

- 0.36b14: Support added for CoCo 3 hires graphics [Nate Woods].

- 0.36b12: Enabled the Disk Basic ROM (disk.rom) for the CoCo and CoCo 3 [Nathan].

- 0.36b11: Nate Woods added Coco 3 (preliminary) system.

Amstrad CPC6128, Amstrad plc, 1985


The Amstrad CPC (short for Colour Personal Computer) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe. The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market. The later plus models, 464plus and 6128plus, efforts to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates, were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000. The CPC models' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU, complemented with either 64 or 128 kB of memory. Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated mass storage device, either a compact cassette deck or 3" floppy disk drive. The main units were only sold bundled with a colour or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit's power supply. Additionally, a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as disk drives (for the CPC464), printers, and memory extensions, was available. The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software. The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor, its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users, which is reflected by a wide selection of application software. During its lifetime, the CPC series sold approximately three million units.

Apparently each company bought the hardware and made slight modifications to the insides and outsides, so some of the games work on other systems and some don't. There were "converters" made so that games from affiliated machines could be played on each other. There at least exists a converter to play Interton games on this machine.The company Voltmace was rather small (only about 12 employees) and got started making Joysticks form British computers, notably the BBC Micro. Games were written in 2650 assembly language. The games seem to have mostly been programmed by one person (source: http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/classics/voltmace_database.htm).

Dreamcast (USA, NTSC), Sega, 1999


The Dreamcast is a 128-bit video game console which was released by Sega in late 1998 as the successor to the Sega Saturn. It was the first entry in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube. Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in March 2001 and withdrew entirely from the console hardware business, making it the company's final console. Support of the system continued in Europe and Oceania until the end of 2002, while in Japan, consoles were still sold until 2006 and new licensed games continued to be released. According to Bernie Stolar, former President and CEO of Sega of America, the Dreamcast was discontinued because the new chair of Sega wanted the company to focus on software. Despite its short lifespan, the Dreamcast has garnered cult status for its history and features. It was widely hailed as ahead of its time, and is still held in high regard for pioneering online console gaming—it was the first console to include a built-in modem and Internet support for online play. As of 2011, the console is still supported through various MIL-CD independent releases (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast).

Didaktik Gama 87, Didaktik Skalica, 1987


Didaktik Gama was the first clone of the ZX Spectrum with one speciality: 80 KiB RAM divided into two switched 32 KiB memory banks and 16 KiB of slower RAM containing graphical data for video output, while the size of ROM was 16 KiB. This computer had become an unreachable dream for many children and adults in former socialist Czechoslovakia as the computer was considerably expensive and seldom available to buy. It is said there were waiting lists several years long. The design of the computer was very simple — just a grey or black box the size of A5 with flat plastic keyboard and connectors mounted on the rear side. All games developed for the ZX Spectrum 48K were generally compatible with this computer. There is no need to say that it established massive and flourishing black market with these games country-wide as they were officially unavailable behind the "iron curtain". An audio cassette was used as the data store and a TV served as the monitor. Didaktik Gama was produced in three variants: the first, Gama '87, fixed some bugs in the original ZX Spectrum ROM, thus breaking compatibility in some percentage of applications (read: games), and introduced its own bugs effectively inhibiting the use of the second 32 KiB memory bank from BASIC. Gama '88 fixed the original ZX Spectrum bugs in a more compatible way and fixed the memory switching bug. The last and the best model was Gama '89 which fixed some more bugs. Production of Didaktik Gama computers ceased in 1992 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didaktik#Didaktik_Gama).

Didaktik M 91, Didaktik Skalica, 1991


The next version, the Didaktik M introduced in 1990, was more advanced in design and reliability. The machine resembled more of a professional home computer with arrow keys separated from the rest of the keyboard and a more ergonomic shape of the case. Inside there was only 64 KiB of total memory (16 KiB ROM and 48 KiB RAM) which was a disappointment in comparison to the Gama. The computer was considerably redesigned. A custom circuit from Russian company Angstrem was used instead of the original ULA as a result the screen had a square aspect ratio instead of a rectangle 4:3. In addition the whole RAM memory was realized by one set of 64 KiB chips from which only 48 KiB were used and there was no difference between the fast and slow memory with the video content. There were two separated connectors for joysticks and one connector for additional interfaces, such as a printer interface. Unlike the previous version of Didaktik, these connectors were typical "socialistic solution" compatible with nothing that was then available in the CSSR. Thus, users were forced to develop and produce various and sometimes funny home-made interfaces to satisfy their needs. Data storing and monitor type was the same as in the case of the Gama. Two floppy disk drives were developed and released later to offer the possibility of fast saving/loading of various programs. 5.25" floppy disk drive called D40 was introduced in 1992 and featured a "Snapshot" (see also Hibernation_(computing)) button that allowed to store current content of the memory (memory image) on diskette. It was also possible later to load the memory image and continue playing the game (or whatever was stored) from the respective state. 3.5" floppy disk drive called D80 was also introduced later in 1992 at the same time as Didaktik Kompakt was released.

Thus, users were forced to develop and produce various and sometimes funny home-made interfaces to satisfy their needs. Data storing and monitor type was the same as in the case of the Gama. Two floppy disk drives were developed and released later to offer the possibility of fast saving/loading of various programs. 5.25" floppy disk drive called D40 was introduced in 1992 and featured a "Snapshot" (see also Hibernation_(computing)) button that allowed to store current content of the memory (memory image) on diskette. It was also possible later to load the memory image and continue playing the game (or whatever was stored) from the respective state. 3.5" floppy disk drive called D80 was also introduced later in 1992 at the same time as Didaktik Kompakt was released.

An other CP/M / MSDOS hybrid system. This computer had no great commercial success. The Decision Mate V came with 128 KB of RAM, but could be upgraded to 256 or 512 KB with expansion cards. The serial and Centronics interfaces were not on the mainboard, but were added as expansion cards. An additional card with a 68000 was developed by NCR in order to use CP/M 68 (source: http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=299).

0.36b6 [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Dragon 32, Dragon Data Ltd, 1982


The Dragon 32 and Dragon 64 are home computers that were built in the 1980s. The Dragons are very similar to the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo), and were produced for the European market by Dragon Data, Ltd., in Port Talbot, Wales, and for the US market by Tano of New Orleans, Louisiana. The model numbers reflect the primary difference between the two machines, which have 32 and 64 kilobytes of RAM, respectively.

WIP:

- 0.135: Added same input devices as CoCo. Converted inputs to use PORT_CATEGORY (i.e. you now select controller type in the Categories submenu).

- 0.37b11: Fixed DragonDOS cartrdige, so now DragonDOS works fine [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b8: Added support for printer. Optimized graphics emulation [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b5: Converted the Dragon driver to use an include file, moved PAK loading code into a new src/mess/formats directory [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b4: Now supports memory size SAM register, removed 2nd fire button from joysticks (only CoCo 3 has this). Video display now draws border [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b3: Better .CAS file support, now supports cassette writes, slightly better .PAK file support [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b2: Now supports a new variant of the .PAK file format for snapshots [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b1: COCO/DRAGON now supports two distinct joysticks [Nate Woods].

Apricot F1, ACT, 1984


In 1984 ACT released a home computer, the "Apricot F1." It ran MS-DOS with "Activity", a GUI front end; like the Apricot PC, it was not IBM PC compatible. The machine was only successful in the UK. It was bundled with software for graphics, communication, word processing, a spreadsheet, some games, and system tools. It had one 3.5" floppy disk (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot_Computers#1980s).

Apricot F10, ACT, 1985


In 1985 ACT was renamed "Apricot Computers". By this time, the F1 had become one model in the F Series; other machines in the series were the F1e (a cheaper F1 with less RAM standing at 256KB); the F2 (with two floppy drives) and the F10 (with a 10MB Rodime hard drive, 512KB RAM and a more conventional-looking infra-red keyboard). The Activity GUI was replaced by GEM. The F1e contained a 360KB single sided floppy drive, and the F10 contained a 720KB double sided drive. Some F1e computers shipped with an expansion card that could also be used in the F10, that would modulate the RGB video signal to RF enabling the computer to be used with a domestic television set. This card also contained a composite video output. The machine was unusual in that it contained the same 36-way Centronics parallel port that appeared on many contemporary printers (and continued to do so until virtually replaced with USB and ethernet). This means that a standard 36-way centronics male to centronics male cable needs to be used to connect a printer - and these were hard to find since IBM had introduced the DB25F connector (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot_Computers#1980s).

The FM 77 AV was an impressive system in 1985. It's a good example of what was developped in Japan and we never heard of in the rest of the world. The system has great audio and video features, hence the AV for "Audio and Video". It can display 640 x 200 pixels in two colors, or 320 x 200 in 4096 colors ! There is even a multipage mode where you can define two 460 x 200 screens with 8 colors each, or six 640 x 200 monochrome screens! (source: http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=373).

Apricot Portable / FP, ACT, 1984


Apricot Portable was Apricot Computers' attempt at a portable computer, first released in 1984. It had a 3.5" floppy drive, 4.77 MHz CPU and 256 KiB RAM. It was the first computer to use an 80-column/25-line LCD and speech recognition for input/output. The speech recognition software held 4096 words, with only 64 available at a given time. It was also unique in the way that it had an infrared link between it and the keyboard; this was relatively new at the time. However, if an object blocked the infrared beam, communications would be cut off. The Apricot also featured a somewhat Mac-like graphical interface. It was originally priced at £1965 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot_Computers#1980s).

Galeb, PEL Varazdin, 1981


Galeb was an 8-bit computer developed by the PEL Varaždin company in Yugoslavia in the early 1980s. A grand total of 250 were produced by the end of the summer of 1984, before being replaced by Orao. Galeb was designed by Miroslav Kocijan and inspired by Compukit UK101 and Ohio Scientific Superboard and Superboard II computers that appeared in the UK and USA in 1979 and were less expensive than Apple II, Commodore PET and/or TRS-80 computers. The code name YU101 was chosen to resemble Compukit's UK101.

Game Boy, Nintendo, 1990


The Game Boy, is an 8-bit handheld video game device developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on April 21, 1989, in North America in August 1989, and in Europe on September 28, 1990. It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line, and was created by Gunpei Yokoi and Nintendo Research & Development 1—the same staff who had designed the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Game Boy is Nintendo's second handheld system following the Game & Watch series introduced in 1980, and the B&W system combined features from both the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game & Watch. It was originally bundled with the puzzle game Tetris. Despite many other, technologically superior handheld consoles introduced during its lifetime, the Game Boy was a tremendous success. The Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide. Upon its release in the United States, it sold its entire shipment of one million units within weeks (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy).

Game.com, Tiger, 1997


The Game.com (styled as game.com but pronounced as "game com," not "game dot com") is a handheld game console released by Tiger Electronics in September 1997. It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience, sporting PDA-style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus. Unlike other handheld game consoles, the first Game.com consoles included two slots for game cartridges and could be connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem. Later models reverted to a single cartridge slot.

Game Pocket Computer, Epoch, 1984


The Epoch Game Pocket Computer is a handheld game console released by Epoch in Japan in 1984. It was one of the very few truly handheld systems to be released in the early 1980s, preceding the Game Boy by 5 years. The Game Pocket Computer used an LCD screen with a 75 × 64 resolution, and could produce graphics at about the same level as early Atari 2600 games. The system was a failure in Japan, and as a result, only 5 games were made for it. A puzzle game and a paint program were built into the system. It was powered by 4 AA batteries, and screen's brightness could be adjusted by the user. Possibly due to its failure in Japan, the Game Pocket Computer was never released in North America. The unit is extremely rare, and units on eBay can go for hundreds of dollars, when and if they turn up. Except for their moderately successful Cassette Vision, Epoch had no other released systems.

The Game Boy Light was released on April 14, 1998 for ¥6,800[27] and was only available in Japan. Considered the rarest of rare Game Boys, NIB Game Boy Light units regularly sell in the triple-figures on online auction websites. The Game Boy Light is only slightly bigger than the Game Boy Pocket and features an Electroluminescent backlight for low-light conditions. It uses 2 AA batteries, which gave it approximately 20 hours with the light off and 12 with it on. It was available in two standard colors; Gold and Silver, as well as numerous special editions. There is an Astro Boy edition with a clear case with an Astro Boy picture on it. There is a Osamu Tezuka World shop edition with a clear red case and a picture of his characters. There is a Pokémon Center Tokyo version in yellow color. There is a clear 'skeleton' Famitsu edition which had only 5,000 units released. There is a clear yellow edition separate from the solid yellow Pokémon Center Tokyo version.

Game Boy Pocket, Nintendo, 1996


In 1996, Nintendo released the Game Boy Pocket: a smaller, lighter unit that requires fewer batteries. It has space for two AAA batteries, which provide about 10 hours of game play. The Pocket has a smaller link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older Game Boy. The port design is used on all subsequent Game Boy models, excluding the Game Boy Micro. The screen was changed to a true black-and-white display, rather than the "pea soup" monochromatic display of the original Game Boy. Also Game Boy Pocket (GBP) has a larger screen than the Game Boy Color (GBC) that later superseded it, the GBP's screen is 65mm (2.56") diagonal, width 48.5mm (1.91"), height 43.5mm (1.71") compared to a 59mm (2.32") diagonal for the GBC. Again, and like the Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket has no backlight to allow play in a darkened area. The first version did not have an LED to show battery levels. This was soon added due to public demand, along with new Game Boy Pocket units of different colors, some of them new to the Game Boy line. There were several limited-edition Game Boy Pockets including a metallic Ice Blue unit and a pink model exclusive to Japan. The Game Boy Pocket was not a new software platform and played the same software as the original Game Boy model.

Geneve 9640, Myarc, 1987


The Geneve 9640 is an enhanced TI-99/4A clone which was built by Myarc as a card to fit into the TI Peripheral Expansion System and used an IBM PC XT detached keyboard as well as a mouse. Released in 1987, it was in many ways similar to the earlier TI-99/8 which was in prototype form in early 1983. The Geneve, its custom ASIC chip, and the MDOS operating environment were designed by Paul Charlton.[1] The graphical swan on the boot up screen was designed by Mi-Kyung Kim. The unit included a faster processor (12 MHz TMS9995), enhanced graphics with 80 column text mode (via the Yamaha V9938 video display processor), 16 bit wide RAM, MDOS, and was compatible with nearly all TI software. An adapter was available from a company called Rave to allow the sidecar-only Speech Synthesizer to be installed inside the Peripheral Expansion System.

- 0.85: Updated the IDE card emulation with the latest changes to the prototype. The latest prototype is incompatible with earlier prototypes (IDE bus has been byte-swapped), so you need to download the latest DSRs and use a new, blank IDE hard disk image.  Also, the state of the IDE clock chip (rtc65271) is now saved to disk, so that you can use a rtc bootstrap loader to load IDEAL from the IDE harddisk, as explained in Nouspickel's IDEAL page [Raphael Nabet].

Gizmondo, Tiger Telematics, 2005


The Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console which was released by Tiger Telematics in March 2005. The electronics design was undertaken by Plextek Limited and the industrial design by Rick Dickinson. With fewer than 25,000 units sold, the Gizmondo was named by GamePro as the worst selling handheld console in history. By February 2006, the company discontinued the device and was forced into bankruptcy. In 2008, founder and CEO Carl Freer announced that he had reached an agreement with the liquidators, and planned to re-launch Gizmondo as Gizmondo 2. Gizmondo was overshadowed by the involvement of one of its executives, Stefan Eriksson, in organized crime. It was never released in Japan or Australia.

Amstrad GX4000, Amstrad plc, 1990


The GX4000 was Amstrad's short-lived attempt to enter the games console market. The console was released in Europe in 1990 and was based on the still-popular CPC technology. The GX4000 was actually a modified CPC 6128 Plus computer. This allowed the GX4000 to be compatible with a majority of CPC Plus computer line software. Initial reviews were favorable — the console had impressive enhanced graphics and sound, a huge color palette of 4096 (more than the 16 bit Sega Mega Drive), hardware sprites and hardware scrolling. It retailed for £99 and came bundled with driving game Burnin' Rubber. GX4000 game cartridges could also be used by the new 464 and 6128 Plus computers released at the same time (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_GX4000).

Heathkit H8, Heath, Inc., 1977


Heathkit's H8 was an Intel 8080-based microcomputer sold in kit form starting in 1977. The H8 was similar to the S-100 bus computers of the era, and like those machines was often used with the CP/M operating system on floppy disk. The main difference between the H8 and S-100 machines was the bus; the H8 used a 50-pin bus design that was smaller, more robust and better engineered electrically. The machine also included a bootstrap ROM that made it easier to start up, including code for running basic input/output and allowing input through a front-mounted octal keypad and front panel display instead of the binary switches and lights used on machines like the Altair 8800. The H8 was a successful design but required a separate terminal to be truly useful; Heathkit introduced several terminals as well. A successor model, the "All-in-One" Heathkit H89, combined a Z-80 processor board and a floppy disk drive into the cabinet of an Heathkit H19 terminal. This model also was sold in fully assembled form as the WH89. These were later sold by Zenith Electronics with their name on the front as the Zenith Z89 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit_H8).

Heathkit H89, Heath Inc, 1979


In 1978 Heath introduced the Heathkit H88 which combined the H19 terminal and a new Zilog Z80-based single-board processor into the case of the H19. A version with a disk drive incorporated to the right of the terminal screen became the H89. The machines bore a strong resemblance to the TRS-80 Model III and similar all-in-one computers. The H89 was available both in kit form for $1595, and fully assembled form as the WH89 for $2295. Soon after the introduction of the H89, Heathkit was purchased by Zenith in order to enter the microcomputer market.[5] They continued sales of the H89 with their own labeling on the front as the Zenith Z89. Eventually, Zenith Data Systems (Heathkit plus the computer division of Zenith) was purchased by Bull HN (CII Bull, Honeywell and Nippon Electric) because they needed a US maker of microcomputers in order to comply with government purchase requirements. Kit sales were ended soon after that purchase (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit_H8).

HC-85, ICE-Felix, 1985


A series of ZX Spectrum clones was manufactured in Romania from 1985 to 1994 by ICE Felix. The designation HC means Home Computer, and for the first three models in the series, the number is the year of first manufacture. Models in the series were: HC 85, HC 88, HC 90, HC 91, HC91+ (HC128), HC 2000, HC386. The earliest version, HC 85, closely resembled the Spectrum, with a built-in BASIC interpreter, Z80A processor, 48k RAM, tape, serial and TV interfaces. It was used in schools/universities and as a personal computer (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_HC_85,_HC_90,_HC_91,_HC_2000#Felix_HC_series).

Horizon (DD drive), NorthStar, 1979


The Horizon was a S-100 bus based system. It was the first floppy-disc based system hobbyists could buy. In a case with a choice of wood or blue metal cover, the basic version included a 4 MHz. Z80 microprocessor, 16 KB of RAM, a 90 KB 5''1/4 floppy drive with a controller card, a serial terminal interface and 12 S-100 slots. It was sold with the North Star Disc Operating System and a Basic interpreter, allowing random and sequential disk files. The Horizon-2 version offered a second floppy-disc drive. Any S-100 cards (compatible with Altair, Cromemco and many other systems) could be added to the system, but North Star provided its own additional 16 KB RAM and hardware floating point boards. In 1979, original 90 KB floppy drives were replaced by Shugart 360 KB models. NorthStar also offered an add-on box with two additional floppies, making a total of 4. The box had a matching walnut stained plywood cover (source: http://oldcomputermuseum.com/northstar_horizon.html).

Intellivision, Mattel, 1979


The Intellivision is a video game console released by Mattel in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The word intellivision is a portmanteau of "Intelligent Television". Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console. In 2009, video game website IGN named the Intellivision the No. 14 greatest video game console of all time (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellivision).

	* Converted intv driver to use native Intellivision resolution of 159x192; scaled intvkbd driver so carts look correct.

	* Added overscan borders.  Approximate, but at least measured on an actual Intellivision.

	* Added a STIC header file, defining various object sizes, and register and bit names.

	* Cleaned up render_color_stack_mode() and render_fg_bg_mode() loops, eliminating the ugly fix-ups at the end of each row.

	* Updated the code found in UNUSED_FUNCTION, but neither compiled nor tested it.

* Added optional alternate disc control using analog inputs. Use "Driver Configuration" menu to enable analog support per hand controller.

* Renamed "DEL" to "Clear", "ENTER" to "Enter", "But1" to "Upper", "But2" to "Lower-Left" and "But3" to "Lower-Right".

* Removed frogger hack -- must use left hand controller to play.

Kaypro 2x, Non Linear Systems, 1984


Kaypro began as Non-Linear Systems, a maker of electronic test equipment, founded in 1952 by Andrew Kay, the inventor of the digital voltmeter. Kaypro 2X - The Kaypro 2X was similar to the Kaypro 4, but it lacked the built-in 300 baud modem that was available in the Kaypro 4. Kaypro 2X's were often sold in a bundle with the Wordstar word processing software suite, spreadsheet and database software. The impact printer that was also included in the bundle was labeled as the "Kaypro Printer", but was actually a re-branded Juki 6100 daisywheel printer.

KC Compact, VEB Mikroelektronik, 1989


The Kleincomputer KC Compact ("Kleincomputer" being a rather literal German translation of the English "microcomputer") is a clone of the Amstrad CPC built by East Germany's VEB Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen in 1989. Although the machine included various substitutes and emulations of an Amstrad CPC's hardware, the machine is largely compatible with Amstrad CPC software. It is equipped with 64 kB memory and a CPC6128's firmware customized to the modified hardware, including an unmodified copy of Locomotive BASIC 1.1. The KC Compact is the last 8-bit computer produced in East Germany.

The Pioneer LaserActive was a short-lived Laserdisc-based game console released by Pioneer in 1993. In addition to LaserActive games, separately sold add-on modules (referred to as "PAC" by Pioneer) expanded the hardware to include compatibility with the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 game cartridges and HuCards and CDs. It ended up being a commercial failure.

LaserActive (Japan, NTSC), Pioneer, 1993


The Pioneer LaserActive was a short-lived Laserdisc-based game console released by Pioneer in 1993. In addition to LaserActive games, separately sold add-on modules (referred to as "PAC" by Pioneer) expanded the hardware to include compatibility with the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 game cartridges and HuCards and CDs. It ended up being a commercial failure.

Leonardo, GiG Electronics, 1982


This system is an Italian Arcadia 2001 clone. "Gig" was an electronics manufacturer that also made clones of computers and maybe other game systems. I don't know why anyone would call a game system "Leonardo." When I hear that name I think Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Has at least 35 games published under the Leonardo label (source: http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/gig_leonardo.htm).

Lisa, Apple Computer, 1983


The Apple Lisa—also known as the Lisa—was a personal computer designed by Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple, Inc.) during the early 1980s. Development of the Lisa began in 1978 as a powerful personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI,) targeted toward business customers. In 1982, Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, so he joined the Macintosh project instead. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems and the final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL. The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of that time in many respects, such as its inclusion of protected memory, cooperative multitasking, a generally more sophisticated hard disk based operating system, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to two megabytes (MB) of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names (with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and a larger higher-resolution display. It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. Protected memory, for instance, did not arrive until the Mac OS X operating system was released in 2001. The Macintosh featured a faster 68000 processor (7.89 MHz) and sound. The complexity of the Lisa operating system and its programs taxed the 5 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor so that consumers said it felt sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa).

Lisa2, Apple Computer, 1984


The first hardware revision, the Lisa 2, released in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US.[7] It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single 400k Sony microfloppy. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512k RAM. An external ProFile and internal Widget drive were available as standard options in different configurations. In 1984, at the same time the Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first Snow White design language features. There were relatively few third-party hardware offerings for the Lisa, as compared to the earlier Apple II.[citation needed] AST offered a 1.5 MB memory board, which — when combined with the standard Apple 512 KB memory board — expanded the Lisa to a total of 2 MB of memory, the maximum the MMU could address. Late in the product life of the Lisa, there were third-party hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3½ inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa features expansion slots. Like the Apple II, it was an 'open system'. The Lisa 2 motherboard had a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of edge connector sockets/slots. There were two RAM slots, one CPU slot and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there were three 'Lisa' slots, parallel to each other. This flexibility provided the potential for a developer to create a replacement for the CPU 'card' to upgrade the Lisa to run a newer CPU, albeit with potential limitations from other parts of the system (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa).

Lynx, Atari, 1989


The Atari Lynx is a 16-bit handheld game console that was released by Atari Corporation in 1989. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first handheld electronic game with a color LCD. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. The Lynx was released in 1989, the same year as Nintendo's best-selling, monochromatic Game Boy. However, the Lynx failed to achieve the sales numbers required to attract quality third party developers, and was eventually abandoned. Today, as with many older consoles, there is still a small group of devoted fans, creating and selling games for the system (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx).

Lynx 128k, Camputers, 1983


The Lynx was an 8-bit British home computer that was first released in early 1983 as a 48 kB model. The designer of the Lynx was John Shireff and several models were available with 48 kB, 96 kB or 128 kB RAM. It was possible reach 192 kB with RAM expansions on-board. The machine was based around a Z80A CPU clocked at 4 MHz, (6 MHz for the 128/192 kB models) and featured a Motorola 6845 as video controller. It was possible to run CP/M with the optional 5.25" floppy disk-drive on the 96 kB and 128 kB models. The machine was quite advanced for the time, but the high price (48 kB : £225, 96 kB : £299, 128k : £345) compared to its competitors, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and the Oric 1, and lack of software was probably the reason for its short life.

M-10, Olivetti, 1983


On the portable personal computer Olivetti M-10 once again ranks among the leading producers of computer science. The 'Olivetti M-10 may in fact be considered one of the first true portable, small and compact, powered by simple AA batteries. It has the shape of a box in which the keyboard is set, while the long liquid crystal display can be rotated to a more convenient. The microprocessor that drives the 'Olivetti M-10 is an Intel 8085 8-bit, with 32 KB of memory available. The operating system is the owner of Olivetti, and incorporates 4 resident programs: a text editor, a small database, an agenda and a communications program. Just the versatility of this latest software made the 'Olivetti M-10 is particularly suitable for connection to databases and remote computers, so that the computer was preferred by journalists. And 'remarkable ability to save the CMOS of the' M-10 (the internal memory writable) data and documents created, without using tapes or floppy disks: these are also stored with the computer turned off and may possibly be transferred via modem or serial port (source: http://www.computermuseum.it/museum/Olivetti_M-10.htm - Translated by Google!).

Olivetti L1 M20, Olivetti, 1981


In 1982 he joined the Olivetti views of major manufacturers of personal computers with the Olivetti M-20 model. This model, however, was not the first Italian computer in the house: a few years before the laptop was available Olivetti M-10, a little gem, and even more distant in time, in 1967, Olivetti launched on the market the first real home computer , P-101. However, few understand the importance of such a machine: the time was not ripe and had to wait our own computers. The 'Olivetti M-20 was developed in American factories of Cupertino, a processor 16-bit Z-8001. This choice made it impossible to use the MS-DOS and Olivetti decided to develop its own operating system, the PCOS. Today such a product is considered a fine example of the original computer, but then proved too limited to users: Some models could run a primitive version of MS-DOS, but it was necessary to start the computer with an Intel seconds. In appearance the 'Olivetti M-20 is present divided into two main bodies, the monitor and the cabinet: it combines the keyboard and two-disk drives in an elegant plastic wrap. All internal and external parts are easily removable to allow users to easily replace the defective parts (source: http://www.computermuseum.it/museum/Olivetti_M-20.htm - Traslated by Google!).

Macintosh Classic, Apple Computer, 1990


The Macintosh Classic was a personal computer manufactured by Apple Computer. Introduced on October 15, 1990, it was the first Apple Macintosh to sell for less than US$1,000. Production of the Classic was prompted by the success of the Macintosh Plus and the SE. The system specifications of the Classic were very similar to its predecessors, with the same 9-inch (23 cm) monochrome CRT display, 512×342 pixel resolution, and 4 megabyte (MB) memory limit of the older Macintosh computers. Apple's decision to not update the Classic with newer technology such as a 68010 CPU, higher RAM capacity or color display ensured compatibility with the Mac's by-then healthy software base as well as enabled it to fit the lower price-point Apple intended for it. Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25 percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive 3.5-inch (9 cm) floppy disk drive as standard. The Classic was an adaptation of Jerry Manock's and Terry Oyama's 1984 Macintosh 128K industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions that ranged from $1,000 to $1,500. Reviewer reactions were mixed; most focused on the slow processor performance and lack of expansion slots. The consensus was that the Classic was only useful for word processing, spreadsheets and databases. The lower price and the availability of education software led to the Classic's popularity in education. It was sold alongside the more powerful Macintosh Classic II in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.

Mega-CD (Europe, PAL), Sega, 1993


The Mega-CD (Sega CD in North America) is an add-on device for the Mega Drive video game console, designed and produced by Sega and released in Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and North America. The device adds a CD-ROM drive to the Mega Drive, allowing the user to play CD-based games and providing additional hardware functionality. The Mega-CD can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs. The development of the Mega-CD was confidential; game developers were not made aware of what exactly they were working on until the add-on was finally revealed at the Tokyo Toy Show in Japan. The Mega-CD was designed to compete with the PC Engine CD (TurboGrafx-16 CD) in Japan, which had a separate CD-ROM drive. The first version of the Mega-CD sits underneath the Mega Drive console and loads CDs via a motorized tray. A second version places a top-loading CD-ROM drive to the right of the console and is intended primarily for use with the redesigned Sega Mega Drive 2. Both versions of the Mega-CD are compatible with the initial two versions of the Mega Drive console, but not with the Mega Drive 3 or Genesis 3 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega-CD).

Mega Drive (Japan, NTSC), Sega, 1988


The Mega Drive is a fourth-generation video game console released by Sega in Japan in 1988 and Europe, Australia and other PAL regions in 1990. The console was released in North America in 1989 under the name Sega Genesis, since Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in that region. The Mega Drive was Sega's third home console and the successor to the Sega Master System, with which it is electronically compatible. The Mega Drive was the first of its generation to achieve notable market share in Europe and North America. The Mega Drive was originally launched to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment System and NEC's PC-Engine. Two years later, Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and the competition between the two would dominate the 16-bit era of video gaming. The Mega Drive began production in Japan in 1988 and ended with the last new licensed game being released in 2002 in Brazil. The Mega Drive is Sega's most successful console; though Sega has never released a total sales figure quote, sales estimates have ranged from 29 million to over 40.8 million. The console and its games continue to be popular among fans, collectors, retro gamers, emulation enthusiasts and the fan translation scene. There are also several indie game developers continuing to produce games for the console. Many games have been re-released in compilations for newer consoles and/or offered for download on various online services, such as Wii Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and Steam. In 2009, IGN named the console the fifth greatest video game console, out of a field of 23 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_megadrive).

MegaDuck/Cougar Boy, Creatronic/Videojet/Timlex/Cougar, 1993


The Mega Duck WG-108 (also known as Cougar Boy) is a handheld game console that was produced by several companies (Creatronic, Videojet, and Timlex), and came on the market in 1993. It was sold for about €60 (fl 129,-) mainly in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. In South America (mainly in Brazil), the Chinese-made Creatronic version was distributed by Cougar USA, also known as "Cougar Electronic Organization [sic]", and sold as the "Cougar Boy". The cartridges are very similar to the ones of the Watara Supervision, but slightly narrower with fewer contacts (36 pins, whereas the Supervision has 40). Conceptually the electronics inside the Supervision and the Mega Duck are also very similar. The position of the volume controls, contrast controls, buttons, and connectors are virtually identical. However, the LCD of the Supervision is larger than the Mega Duck's. The Cougar Boy came with a 4-in-one game cartridge and a stereo earphone. With an external joystick (not included) two players could play against each other simultaneously (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Duck).

MegaPC, Amstrad plc, 1993


The Mega PC was manufactured and released by Amstrad in 1993 under licence from Sega. It was similar, but unrelated to the Sega TeraDrive. Essentially just a standard Amstrad PC with Sega Mega Drive hardware bundled inside, the system was wired to share the dual-sync monitor and speakers, with the Mega Drive on a separate circuit board. Initially released in PAL areas such as Europe and Australia in 1993,[2] its success was very short-lived due to its very high retail price of £999.99 (later reduced to £599), with the CPU also being outdated by the time of the system's release. It is slightly easier and cheaper to acquire an Amstrad Mega PC in Europe due to more units being manufactured, than it is to acquire a Sega TeraDrive elsewhere. In recent years, both systems have increasingly become relatively difficult to come by, as they are owned and often purchased by many as collector's items (soource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_Mega_PC).

MailStation, CIDCO, 1999


The CIDCo MailStation was a portable e-mail terminal first introduced by CIDCO Inc in 1999 at Amazon.com and was marketed as the Mivo 100 by EarthLink. The MailStation is no longer sold by either EarthLink or Amazon. The MailStation was designed to send and receive e-mails via a standard POTS telephone line. It was intended as an alternative to a laptop computer in regards to its messaging capabilities and also as an alternative to a personal computer for those who for whatever reason do not have access to one but who wish to enjoy the benefits of e-mail. The device could hold up to four hundred messages and up to one thousand contacts. Since it was not a personal/laptop computer, the MailStation could not be used to view attachments.

- 19/11/2011 r13311: More consistency fixes for game descriptions in msx1_cart.xml [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.130: Updated to use the centronics interface [Dirk Best].

- 0.129: Update of Toshiba HX-20, HX-23 memory map. Update of Panasonic MSX disk ROMs [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.114: Fixed MSX visible area [MJSTY].

- 0.105: Fixed a crash involving cartridge use (bug #841) [Nate Woods]. Fixed subtle memory corruption bug [R. Belmont, Wilbert Pol].

- 0.97: Fixed regressions caused by Z80 port changes (bugs #707, #708, #709, #715) [Nate Woods].

- 0.95: Fixed a sound regression introduced in the 0.93 MAME core update (bug #683) [Nate Woods].

- 0.86: Fixed a regression in which certain input ports were being ignored. This was caused by a defect in PORT_INCLUDE [Nate Woods].

- 0.79: Rewrote memory emulation [Sean Young]:

  * Proper memory layout for the MSX2 drivers, with the diskrom in a subslot of slot 3.

  * Adds support for Konami's Sound Cartridge (128kb).

  * Adds support for Korean 90-in-1.

  * Adds support for Kanji ROM.

  * If no cartridges are supplied, it sets the Sound Cartridge in slot 1 and the FM-PAC in slot 2. The Snatcher, SD-Snatcher and the Konami Game Collections now work. Note that Sound Cartridge also behaves as a normal SCC. With one cartridge supplied the FM-PAC is still set in slot 2 so R-Type and other ROM cartridges can still use it.

- 0.77: Changed CPU core on these systems from Z80_MSX to Z80. Since the MAME core now has CPU opcode reading safety now, Z80_MSX is no longer necessary [Nate Woods].

- 0.67: Added support for new GoodTools file extensions (bugs #277, #278, #279, #350) [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b1: Added a detection routine which can detect most types of megaROMs [Sean Young].

- 0.36RC2: Sean Young added MSX1 (UK) driver; system driver bug fixes [Sean Young].

- 0.36RC1: Sean Young added MSX driver (Japanese and Korean). MSX system update which includes FM-PAC emulation, SRAM (uses the YM2413 emulation), added support for the device_extrainfo (...) call for the cartridge mapper type, R-Type and Gall force cartridge mapper emulation, and support for Konami's Synthesizer DAC [Sean Young].

- 0.36b16: Huge MSX update, which includes rom mapper emulation for nearly all type of cartridges (including saving sram as MEMCARD), SIMPL emulation, fixed interrupt emulation, added key-click emulation, and small bugfixes / rewrites! [Sean Young].

- 0.36b13: Added MSX system.

Nintendo Entertainment System / Famicom (NTSC), Nintendo, 1985


The Nintendo Entertainment System (also called NES or Nintendo) is an 8-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986 and Australia in 1987. In most of Asia, including Japan (where it was first launched in 1983), China, Vietnam, Singapore, Middle East and Hong Kong, it was released as the Family Computer (Famiri Konpyuta?), commonly abbreviated as the Famicom (Famikon?, listen (help·info), or FC for short). In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. In Russia, an unlicensed clone was manufactured called Dendy. A clone that was popular in Eastern Europe in the 1990s was the Super Design Ending-Man BS-500 AS, also known as Terminator. Similarly in India, clones were popular by the names of Little Master and Wiz Kid, in Poland there also was a clone produced, called Pegasus. in Argentina, the clone was called Family Game. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. As the best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 and set the standard for subsequent consoles of its generation. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute software for Nintendo's platform. In 2009, the Nintendo Entertainment System was named the single greatest video game console in history by IGN, out of a field of 25. 2010 marked the system's 25th anniversary, which was officially celebrated by Nintendo of America's magazine Nintendo Power in issue #260 (November 2010) with a special 26-page tribute section. Other video game publications also featured articles looking back at 25 years of the NES, and its impact in the video game console market.

- 20/07/2011 r12280: Demoted Nintendo M82 to GNW for obvious reasons [Angelo Salese].

- 0.143u1: Added several new dumps [Kaylee].

- 0.139: Added support for loading proper dumps with separate PRG and CHR files by using an xml software list, additional emulation features being based on the pcb_type attribute. Also, converted code for iNES and UNIF files to use the new code: this allowed to greatly simplify emulation for many boards and mappers. Simplified emulation of MMC3 clone boards, resulting in more boards correctly emulated and many new boards supported [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.135: Various progresses [Fabio Priuli]:

  * Fixed crash of MMC3 games with no CHR-ROM (bug #1860) [with Rob Bohms].

  * Fixed Pinball Quest graphics problems.

  * Fixed Super Spike V'Ball + Nintendo World Cup menu (last known graphical regression compared to MESS 0.130 and earlier).

  * Re-checked all supported mappers against docs and fixed many mirroring and IRQ problems. Improvements can be seen in Mappers: 16, 18, 22, 32, 40, 45, 46, 65, 67, 69, 75, 78, 82, 86, 87, 91, 93, 95, 115, 118, 133, 232, 241.

  * Added the following Mappers (a few may still have graphical problems): 12, 14, 35, 36, 37, 48, 50, 52, 54, 74, 104, 106, 114, 117, 121, 132, 134, 136, 137, 138, 139, 141, 143, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 152, 153, 155, 156, 159, 166, 167, 171, 172, 173, 176, 177, 178, 179, 191, 192, 194, 195, 196, 197, 199, 201, 202, 204, 205, 207, 212, 213, 214, 216, 217, 221, 243, 245, 246, 250.

  * Added preliminary emulation of the following Mappers: 38, 39, 157, 158, 185, 187, 198, 208, 215, 222, 249, 252, 255.

  * Added info about various Mappers in the source.

  * Added partial support for UNIF files and support for UNIF boards which correspond to already emulated iNES Mappers.

  * Added the following UNIF only boards: BMC-64IN1NOREPEAT, BMC-190IN1, BMC-A65AS, BMC-SUPER24IN1SC03, BMC-T-262, BMC-WS, DREAMTECH01, UNL-AX5705, UNL-CC-21, UNL-T-230.

  * Added (very) preliminary support for the following UNIF only boards: BMC-GS2004, BMC-GS2013, UNL-8237, UNL-KOF97.

- 0.134: Improved NES APU when reading reading $4015 and sprite overflow emulation, fixed 4-screen mirroring. Changed the PPU to use a device memory map (bug #1831), enhancements and improvements to mappers 5, 68, 88, 119 [Robert Bohms].

- 0.133: Fixed mappers #88, #193, added mappers #107, #154 [Heretical One].

- 0.129: Fixed bug #1672 [Wilbert Pol].

- 0.123: Added support for mappers 42, 43, 44, 45 (partial), 46, 47, 49, 51 (partial), 57, 58, 61, 62, 83 (partial), 112, 182, 188, 193 (not working), 200, 201, 202, 203, 206, 240, 241 (partial), 242, 244, 246, 248 [Wilbert Pol].

- 0.119: Improved mapper 82, added support for mapper 140 [Heretical_One].

- 0.108: Various improvements, such as timing and PPU improvements (bug #816) [Brad Oliver].

- 0.103: Switched to use the MAME NES APU implementation [R. Belmont]. PPU, palette reading, mapper and sprite handling enhancements and implemented some undocumented N2A03 opcodes (bugs #810, #811) [Rob Bohms].

- 0.98: Fixed NES timing (bug #724) [Andrew Church].

- 0.81: Fixed a crash when running certain games such as the SMB/Duck Hunt cartridge (bug #534) [Nate Woods].

- 0.72: Updated NES so that it uses the ppu2c03b support within MAME (which was actually originally based on the MESS NES driver code) [Brad Oliver, Nate Woods].

- 0.56.1: Now uses battery_save() and battery_load() to save and load battery backed NVRAM [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b7: New sound core [Matt Conte].

- 0.37b6: Now gets correct mapper info from nes.crc (if present) [Cowering].

- 0.37b5: Now features battery support and vastly improved PPU emulation - compare Kirby and RC Pro Am.

  * Palette is no longer hardcoded - it is mathematically generated. It may need some formulaic tweaking, but it's pretty accurate.

  * Games like GI Joe Atlantis Factor are working again, the NES Test cartridge no longer fails.

  * There is a compile switch to emulate the color intensity used in Chris Covell's "Wall" demo. It's off by default because it requires 16-bit mode and the sprite blitters need rewriting to support 16-bit. Still, you can enable it to see the demo run as it was intended.

  * Many mapper fixes: mapper 18 irqs should be close, mapper 19 added, the mid-20 Konami mappers are nearly 100%, and some of the mappers in the 60's are much more accurate.

  * Super Mario 3  _finally_ works! Excitebike also works again, and elite and PAL games, Elite will draw properly -- but only using the PAL NES emulation.

  * Fixed some more timing errors, Bayou Billy sine wave looks perfect now.

  * low/high sprite priorities fixed. Super Mario 3 uses low priority sprites to mask out pieces of high priority ones.

  * low-priority sprite/background transparency problem fixed (see Jaleco's Bases Loaded 3).

  * Mapper 5 is much better, although some interrupt problems remain.

  * Mappers 9/10 are _almost_ perfect.

  * Fixed mapper 16 - it was completely wrong.

  * Fixed rendering problems in mapper 68 (Afterburner 2).

  * Fixed mapper 69 (Batman: Return of the Joker).

  * Mapper 70 (arkanoid 2 j) works, but is it right? It starts up on round 0, which appears to be the last round and not the first.

  * Implemented some Taito mappers (80, 82).

  * Implemented Konami VRC7, minus OPL (mapper 85).

  * Preliminary support for the zapper via a fake dipswitch. Collision detection isn't working yet.

  * Modified sound core to read dpcm samples from the right place in memory. Added clock specifier and read/write callbacks for register $14. NES driver now hooks into this for sprite DMA.

  * Zapper support, configurable via the fake dipswitches. Most games look for it connected to the 2nd input port, not the first. Tested it with Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. If any other zapper games don't work, let me know and I'll beat them down.

  * 4-player joypad support, also configurable via the fake dipswitches. For best results, set both ports to the double setting. I tested it in Gauntlet 2 and RC Pro Am 2. Again, let me know if it's busted in any other 4p games.

  * Fixed sprite priorities for the last time. I swear it's really working now. ;-) As a side effect, the rendering code is a bit faster than before.

  * More mapper fixes/additions.

  * Added support for Famicom Disk System. Split up the main NES driver into NES and Famicom. Only the Famicom supports the disk system, because that's the way it is in real life. Press p1 button 3 to cycle amongst the disk sides. Once you switch a side, you may need to wait a second or two for the switch to be recognized. Let me know if any games fail to see the switch. Disk writing is not yet supported.

  * Added preliminary support for the Arkanoid paddle. It's pretty busted at the moment.

  * Fixed a small PPU bug regarding reads from the chr-gen ram portion of the ppu.

  * Correct display of left-most column when it has been programmatically disabled - see SMB3.

  * Added some more mappers, some of which aren't working fully.

  * Fixed mapper 40 (SMB2j pirate) - it should be close to 100%

  * Fixed some issues with the disk support. It now supports that stupid padded format with the useless header in addition to the other format.

  * DPCM samples fixed (now hear SMB3 in all it's steel drum glory) [Brad Oliver].

- 0.36b12: Memory allocation fix in the NES driver [Juergen Buchmueller]. Gamegear, Genesis and NES CRC updates [Chris Henry & Gerardo]. Please send all CRC/history file contributions to Chris (battlepriest@hotmail.com).

- 0.36b6: Misc. mapper and PPU fixes for the NES. [Brad Oliver, Firebug, Fx3] Adjusted timing of NES clock to be accurate [Brad Oliver].

NewBrain A, Grundy Business Systems Ltd, 1981


The NewBrain project was started in 1978 when Sinclair Radionics began design work with Mike Wakefield as the designer and Basil Smith as the software engineer. This project was intended to provide competition for Apple and hardly fitted in with Sinclair's focus on inexpensive consumer-oriented products. When it became obvious to Sinclair that the NewBrain could not be made for the sub-£100 price he envisaged his thoughts turned to the ZX80 that was to be developed by his other company, Science of Cambridge Ltd. The model 'A' had display to either a TV or a monitor.

0.36b11 [Paul Cook]


Oric 1, Tangerine, 1983


With the success of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum Tangerine's backers suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed Oric Products International Ltd to develop and release the Oric-1 in 1983. Based on a 1 MHz 6502A CPU, it came in 16 KB or 48 KB RAM [2] variants for £129 and £169 respectively, matching the models available for the popular ZX Spectrum and undercutting the price of the 48K Spectrum by a few pounds. Both Oric-1 versions had a 16 KB ROM containing the operating system and a modified BASIC interpreter.

Oric Atmos, Tangerine, 1984


The Edenspring money enabled Oric International to release the Oric Atmos, which added a true keyboard and an updated V1.1 ROM to the Oric-1. The faulty tape error checking routine was still there. Soon after the Atmos was released, the modem, printer and 3-inch floppy disk drive originally promised for the Oric-1 were announced and released by the end of 1984. A short time after the release of the Atmos machine, a modification for the Oric-1 was issued and advertised in magazines and bulletin boards. This modification enabled the Oric-1 user to add a second rom (containing the Oric Atmos system) to a spare rom socket on the Oric-1 circuit board. Then, using a basic DPST (double pole single toggle) switch, the users could then switch between the new Oric Atmos rom and the original Oric-1 rom at their leisure.

  * Implemented 2x2 squares on a single cell mode.

  * Implemented color bank for 128x192x2 mode.

  * Implemented cartslot support.

  * Added skeleton support for the cassette interface, it doesn't work mainly because the MCU directly controls the tape handling.

PC-8801, Nippon Electronic Company, 1981


The NEC PC-8801 was an early Zilog Z80-based computer exclusively released in Japan, where it became very popular, by NEC Corporation in 1981. It was informally called the "PC-88". The PC-8801BE was launched as a business computer in the UK with 8" floppy drives around 1982 but it was not as successful as the PC-8001 it was intended to replace. Variations of the PC-8801 were also sold in the United States.

PC Engine, Nippon Electronic Company, 1987


The PC Engine was a collaborative effort between the relatively young Hudson Soft (founded in 1973) and NEC. NEC's interest in entering the lucrative video game market coincided with Hudson's failed attempt to sell designs for then-advanced graphics chips to Nintendo[5], similar to Nintendo's later rejection of Sony's designs for a Super Famicom CD attachment which evolved into the PlayStation. The PC Engine is a very small video game console, due primarily to a very efficient three-chip architecture and its use of "HuCards" (Hudson Card; also referred to as "TurboChip" in North America and based on the BeeCard technology Hudson piloted on the MSX). The cards were about the size of a credit card (though slightly thicker), similar to the card format used by the Sega Master System for budget games. However, unlike the Sega Master System (which also supported cartridges), the TurboGrafx-16 used HuCards exclusively. TG-16 featured an enhanced MOS Technology 65SC02 processor (dubbed the HuC6280 by Hudson) and a custom 16-bit graphics processor, as well as a custom video color encoder chip, all designed by Hudson. The 'HE System' logo found on the manual of every Japanese game stood for "Hudson Entertainment System".[citation needed] The TurboGrafx-16 was the first console to have an optional CD module, allowing the standard benefits of the CD medium such as more storage, cheaper media costs, and redbook audio. The efficient design, backing of many of Japan's major software producers, and the additional CD ROM capabilities gave the PC Engine a very wide variety of software, with several hundred games for both the HuCard and CD formats. The PC Engine initially performed well in Japan, beating Nintendo's Famicom in sales soon after its release, with no fewer than twelve console models released from 1987 to 1993.[citation needed] Despite the system's early success, it started to lose ground to the Super Famicom. NEC made one final effort to resuscitate the system with the release of the Arcade Card expansion, bringing the total amount of RAM up to a then-massive 2048K. Some Arcade Card games were conversions of popular Neo Geo titles. The expansion was never released in North America. New games were released for the PC Engine up until 1999.

Commodore Plus/4 (NTSC), Commodore Business Machines, 1984


The Commodore Plus/4 was a home computer released by Commodore International in 1984. The "Plus/4" name refers to the four-application ROM resident office suite (word processor, spreadsheet, database, and graphing); it was billed as "the productivity computer with software built-in". It had some success in Europe. A total flop in the United States, it was derided as the "Minus/60"—a pun on the difference between the Plus/4 and the dominant Commodore 64.

Amstrad PPC512, Amstrad plc, 1987


The Amstrad PC1512 was Amstrad's mostly IBM PC-compatible computer system, first manufactured in 1986. It was later succeeded by the PC1640. It launched for £499 and sold very well, as it was one of the first cheap PCs in Europe. It significantly helped open up the European PC market to consumers as well as businesses, and Amstrad's advertising of the PC1512 was aimed at homes rather than offices. The 1512's influence was such that the UK PC magazine PC Plus originally targeted itself at the "Amstrad PC 1512 and compatibles", since home ownership of other PCs at the time was rare.

The SAM Coupé (Pronounced: "Sam Koo-Pay" from its original British English branding) is an 8-bit British home computer that was first released in late 1989. It is commonly considered a clone of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer, since it features a compatible screen mode and emulated compatibility, and it was marketed as a logical upgrade from the Spectrum. It was originally manufactured by Miles Gordon Technology (MGT), based in Swansea in the United Kingdom (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_Coupe).

0.2b4 [Marat Fayzullin, Mathis Rosenhauer, Brad Oliver]


Master System II, Sega, 1990


In 1990, Sega was having success in North America with its Mega Drive and as a result took back the rights from Tonka for the Master System. It designed the Sega Master System II, a low-cost Master System that lacked the reset button, expansion port (which was never used), and card slot of the original. Since the card slot was used as a connector to synchronize the 3D glasses with the original Master System, the SMS2 couldn't use the 3D glasses.

Details are written in source code [Enik Land]. Added an option to play SegaScope (3D-Glasses) games without a seizure: mount any game supporting 3-D in Master System I drivers, enter Driver Configuration menu and turn on SegaScope. At this point, a new option 'Binocular Hack' appears, which removes the flickering in one or both the lens screens (remember that you can enable lens views by selecting the Segascope views from the Video Options menu). The option is turned off by default, being inaccurate [Enik Land, Fabio Priuli].

Master System I, Sega, 1986


The Master System (Masuta Shisutemu?) (abbreviated to SMS) is a third-generation video game console that was manufactured and released by Sega in 1985 in Japan (as the Sega Mark III), 1986 in North America and 1987 in Europe. The original SMS could play both cartridges and the credit card-sized "Sega Cards," which retailed for cheaper prices than carts but had less code. The SMS also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. The Master System was released as a direct competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System in the third videogame generation The SMS was technically superior to the NES, which predated its release significantly, but failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. In the European, Oceanic, and Brazilian markets, this console launched Sega onto a competitive level comparable to Nintendo, due to its wider availability. It enjoyed over a decade of life in those territories. Due to strong international support, the Master System became the second best selling Sega console. With 13 million units sold worldwide, only the Mega Drive sold more.[16] The console was redesigned several times both for marketing purposes and to add features, most notably in Brazil. The later Sega Game Gear is effectively a hand-held Master System, with a few enhancements. In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time (out of 25) by the video gaming website IGN.

Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom (NTSC), Nintendo, 1989


The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (also known as the Super NES, SNES[b] or Super Nintendo) is a 16-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America, Europe, Australasia (Oceania), and South America between 1990 and 1993. In Japan and Southeast Asia, the system is called the Super Famicom, officially adopting the abbreviated name of its predecessor, the Family Computer), or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. Additionally, development of a variety of enhancement chips (which were integrated on game circuit boards) helped to keep it competitive in the marketplace. The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced in North America from Sega's Genesis console. The SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era, and although Nintendo no longer offers factory repairs/replacement or accessories for the console, it continues to be popular among fans, collectors, retro gamers, and emulation enthusiasts, some of whom are still making homebrew ROM images (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System).

ZX Spectrum +3e, Amstrad plc, 2000


The ZX Spectrum +3 looked similar to the +2 but featured a built-in 3-inch floppy disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware. The +3 saw the addition of two more 16 kB ROMs. One was home to the second part of the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad's AMSDOS, called +3DOS. These two new 16 kB ROMs and the original two 16 kB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32 kB chips. To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16 kB of RAM (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_.2B3).

ZX Spectrum, Sinclair Research Ltd, 1982


The ZX Spectrum (the "Z" is pronounced "Zed" from its original British English branding) is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82 the machine was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine's colour display, compared with the black-and-white of its predecessor, the Sinclair ZX81. The Spectrum was ultimately released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level model with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide. The Spectrum was among the first mainstream audience home computers in the UK, similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the USA. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine the effects of which are still seen; some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry. Licensing deals and clones followed, and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for "services to British industry". The Commodore 64, BBC Microcomputer and later the Amstrad CPC range were major rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s. The ZX Spectrum has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to the accessibility of ZX Spectrum emulators, allowing 1980s video game enthusiasts to enjoy classic titles without the long loading times associated with data cassettes. Over 20,000 titles have been released since the Spectrum's launch and new titles continue to be released, with over 90 new ones in 2010.

WIP:

- 08/12/2011 r13522: Apostrophe is fine in filenames too in spectrum.xml [Fabio Priuli].

- 14/11/2011 r13244: Removed HSI files not used and removed pce and sms referencing non existing extrainfo [Micko].

- 0.137: Added .raw quickload support. Converted to use messram device. Added support for .ach, .frz, .plusd, .prg, .sem, .sit, .snp, .snx and .zx snapshot formats. Hopefully fixed existing issues with .sna and .sp formats (both VGASpec-style and Spanish Spectrum-style formats are supported now).

- 0.135: Fixed 48K SNA load routine bad PC (bug #803) [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.133: Added logging support for Text/Message/Archive/Hardware/Custom Blocks in TZX files. Info are not (and won't be) used directly by the emulator, but can be of use to improve bug reports. Also, updated TZX support to v1.20 by deprecating some block types [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.131: Added natural keyboard support [Fabio Priuli]. Removed Spectrum+ keyboard keys from earlier models (and from some clones). Moved Joystick interface selection to the Category Menu [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.128: Added lot of Spectrum clones and custom ROM's [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.125: Homebrew ROMs are now selectable BIOSes instead of separate drivers. IO maps are done in proper way. Split into multiple drivers and cleanup [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.110: Fixed snapshot loading regression introduced in 0.105 [Chad].

- 0.108: Added TZX/TAP cassette format support [Wilbert Pol].

- 0.102: Fixed regression introduced in MESS 0.96 (bugs #726, #761) [Nate Woods].

- 0.62: Fixed snapshot loading [Nate Woods].

- 0.37b15: Interface 2 emulation [David Robertson].

- 0.37b6: Fixed +3 disk handling [David Robertson].

- 0.37b5: The border displaying code is now includes a full refresh flag. 128K port decoding updated (still not exact on +3) - Sound now works on Zub 128K [David Robertson].

- 0.37b4: Added support for .SCR (Screendump) files. Note that to ensure that the image is not immediately overwritten by the ROM initialisation routine the loading routine adds a short machine code press any key routine. The Border engine code now only uses those events with the correct ID instead of all events.  The specpls4 has been is now declared as GAME_COMPUTER_MODIFIED .SCR files are now quickload files and are loaded by pressing F8. The 128K machines are now defined as GAME_NOT_WORKING because of the crashes when running 128K files [David (aka Peter) Robertson].

- 0.37b3: .TAP loading on TS2068 now works, and fixed bug where the last byte in .Z80 blocks was not decoded - Head Over Heels now works. .TAP files now classified as cassettes files not snapshots because of how they are used - this now means they appear on Tape Control menu, corrected clock speed of TS2068, fixed Issue 2/3 dipswitch implementation, dipswitch to enable/disable disk drives on +3 and clones (disabling disk drives on +3 correctly shows machine as +2a on start up menu). Implemented TS2068/TC2048 64 column and hires modes, rewrote Spectrum 128 screen refresh to use plot_pixel for a major speedup. Fixed bug that created a new file if trying to use a non-existant .TAP file, modified border size based on the comp.sys.sinclair FAQ (48 pixels at the left, right and top and 56 pixels at the bottom of the screen, initial support for border colour - fills entire border with last the outputted colour, border colour set when loading snapshots. Added a Border Engine to all Spectrum machines [David Robertson].

- 0.37b2: Added support for 128K .SNA and .Z80 files, ensured that the 48K Basic ROM is paged in when running 48K snapshots on 128K machine (for improved reliability and access to the default character set), changed +3 initialisation, 128 and +3 now set 0x4000-0x7fff to bank 5 (Now not changed if switching to shadow screen), cleaned up spectrum_plus3_update_memory, fixed bug in decoding uncompressed v2+ .Z80 files, and changed running speed of 128K Machines to 3.54690MHz [David Robertson].

- 0.36RC1: Spectrum changes include disk Image support for +3, loading/saving from WAV, Spectrum+/Spectrum 128 keyboard mappings, Improved I/O decoding (Kempston active on all ports xx1f), support for .TAP tape files (use the normal LOAD"" when emulation starts. In Normal Speccy mode press "J" then SHIFT+P ), and Full key descriptions, and 128k .z80 images not loaded.  Also includes "Issue 2" and "Issue 3" emulation [David Robertson, Kev Thacker].

- 0.36b16: Fixed dirty char update in Spectrum driver [Kev Thacker]; setup buzzer sound for Spectrum and +3 [Kev Thacker].

- 0.36b15: Spectrum keys are now displayed in UI [Kev Thacker].

Studio II, RCA, 1977


The RCA Studio II is a videogame console made by RCA that debuted in January 1977. The graphics of Studio II games were black and white and resembled those of earlier Pong consoles and their clones. The Studio II also did not have joysticks or similar game controllers but instead used two ten button keypads that were built into the console itself. This made two player games difficult because the players would be forced to hold the console and sit extremely close. The console was capable of making simple beep sounds with slight variations in tone and length. One distinct feature of the Studio II was its five built-in games. Also unique to the Studio II was its use of a switchbox that relayed both the modulated RF signal of the console's video to the television set while powering the console with DC power. This type of hookup would not be seen again (or thereafter) until the Atari 5200 used a similar video signal and power connection method. The Studio II was not a successful product; it was already obsolete by the time it hit the market when compared to the previously released Fairchild Channel F, and had its "final nail in the coffin" when the superior (to both) Atari 2600 console was released only 10 months later. It was discontinued in 1979. The name "Studio II" is a reference to RCA's then-famous recording studios. The RCA Studio II was named as to represent a second studio in which artists could create productions for RCA.[2] There is not any forerunner console to the Studio II.

ToDo:

* Discrete sound emulation

* CPU frequency needs to be derived from the schematics, there is no oscillator on board, just an NE555 circuit

* BIOS needs to be redumped as 4 separate ROMs


Notes:

* The various color-enabled PAL region clones of RCA Studio II will be emulated as soon as the BIOS has been dumped. Guru is in possession of a Mustang 9016 Telespiel Computer.

0.139 [Juergen Buchmueller, Cowering, Wilbert Pol]


Tandy 1000 TX, Tandy Radio Shack, 1987


The Tandy 1000 TX was very similar to the Tandy 1000, having an external keyboard and similar casing. The most major difference was the use of an 80286 CPU; otherwise, it was nearly identical to the Tandy 1000, including the unique parallel port edge connector. Despite the 80286 processor, it was still an XT-class PC, not an AT-class PC, as it adapted the 80286 to operate over the same 8-bit data bus as previous Tandy 1000 models, and had 8-bit XT-style expansion slots. As such, it could not operate in 80286 protected mode or perform 16-bit memory or I/O transfers in one bus cycle, but it did benefit from the higher speed of the 80286 and its other added instructions in real mode. The TX had a 3.5" internal floppy disk drive, with an optional additional internal 5.25" floppy disk drive. It contained ports for two joysticks in the front along with the keyboard, and included a volume control with a 1/8" headphone jack on the front. The back had all of the same ports as the Tandy 1000, except that the light pen port was replaced with an RS-232 serial port. The memory size was 640k (upgradable to 768k, with the added 128K devoted to video[2]) and the computer came bundled with DeskMate.

TI99/4A Home Computer (US), Texas Instruments, 1981


The Texas Instruments TI-99/4A was an early home computer, released in June 1981, originally at a price of USD $525. It was an enhanced version of the less-successful—and quite rare—TI-99/4 model, which was released in late 1979 at a price of $1,150. The TI-99/4A added an additional graphics mode, "lowercase" characters consisting of small capitals, and a full travel keyboard. Its predecessor, the TI-99/4, featured a calculator-style chiclet keyboard and a character set that lacked lowercase text.

WIP:

- 14/11/2011 r13244: Removed HSI files not used and removed pce and sms referencing non existing extrainfo [Micko].

- 0.143u1: Replaced TRUE/FALSE for line states with ASSERT/CLEAR (which helped to find an inconsistency in the implementation). Added real RS232 connection capability [Michael Zapf].

- 0.136: Fixed a crash when the user mounts cartridge dump files in legacy mode [Michael Zapf].

- 0.135: Changed TI99/4a to use SN94624 sound chip variant [Justin Kerk, Lord Nightmare]. Converted Smartmed and RS232 card to be devices [Miodrag Milanovic]. Added support for two new cartridge types [Michael Zapf].

- 0.133: Implemented p-Code peripheral card [Michael Zapf].

- 0.128: Changed ESC key to map to F12 [Michael Zapf].

- 0.126: Implemented loading and saving of the battery-backed RAM of the MiniMemory cartridge. Fixed disk controller [Michael Zapf].

- 0.125: Natural keyboard fix [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.123: Fixed Mechatronic Mouse axis swapping (bug #966). More floppy cleanups; fixed TI99_8 regression and made the floppy drive usable (bug #1450) [Michael Zapf].

- 0.122: Refactorings and code cleanups [Michael Zapf].

- 0.121: Fixed TI99 border regression [Michael Zapf].

- 0.85: Updated the IDE card emulation with the latest changes to the prototype. The latest prototype is incompatible with earlier prototypes (IDE bus has been byte-swapped), so you need to download the latest DSRs and use a new, blank IDE hard disk image.  Also, the state of the IDE clock chip (rtc65271) is now saved to disk, so that you can use a rtc bootstrap loader to load IDEAL from the IDE harddisk, as explained in Nouspickel's IDEAL page [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.84: Fixed various bugs in HSGPL ROM6 support. Enabled the IDE card for the Geneve and ti99/8 drivers (this involved fixing a design flaw in the original IDE card prototype). Added preliminary support for the SmartMedia part of the USB-SmartMedia card [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.72: Several behind-the-scenes changes to support TI-99/8 emulation (which is not 100% working and disabled in MESS builds but implemented in source code). Hopefully, there will be no change in functionality in the various TI-99/4(a) drivers [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.71: Added support for Mechatronics mouse. Added support for HFDC subdirectories [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.70: Fixed some bugs that had been introduced in IDE emulation. Added hfdc HD support. Changed floppy disk image format from the previous MESS-specific format to the more universal v9t9 format. This does make any difference for single-sided images, but you will need to convert existing double-sided image to the new format [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.68: Added support for Thierry Nouspickel's IDE card prototype. Added incomplete but working support for the HFDC disk controller card and 80-track drives. Added support for a fourth floppy drive with non-TI floppy controllers. Fixed Super AMS memory card emulation [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.67: Added support for new disk geometries (9 sec/trk DSSD, 16 sec/trk SSDD, 16 sec/trk DSDD) [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.56.1: - Xxtensive rewrite: The code should be more flexible and more readable.

  * Updated tms9901 code.

  * Optional floppy controller, speech synthesizer, memory extension can be disabled.

  * Support for super AMS, foundation, and a myarc look-alike memory extension cards.

  * Improved fdc emulation.

  * Better GROM and speech timings.

  * Support for multiple extension cards, and multiple GROM ports.

  * Speech synthesizer now works!!!

  * Added support for EVPC video card [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.37b2: Mini Memory Support (rename minimemc.bin to minimemm.bin for it to work correctly), fixed a bug in banked roms when a hard reset (F3) is done, rom images are now identified by their filename extensions (image order isn't important anymore), no need to use NUL when no grom image, both alt -> fctn and both ctrl -> ctrl added, and new rom image extensions (.c .d .m .g .crom. drom. mrom .grom) [Norberto Alfredo Bensa].

- 0.36b16: Updates to cgenie, trs80 and ti99_4a due to wd179x update [Juergen Buchmueller].

- 0.36b15: TI99_4a display palette (F4) corruption fix [Mathis Rosenhauer].

- 0.36b13: Corrected wd179x to use the new fileio semantics. This fixes the trs80, cgenie and ti99 drivers [Juergen Buchmueller].

- 0.36b12: TI99/4a accessors for the RAM extension fixed, and fixed endianness issues [Raphael Nabet].

- 0.36b11: Renamed (ti99) to (ti994a).

- 0.36b6: Raphael Nabet added TI-994a system.

0.1 [Juergen Buchmueller]

TRS80,Tandy Radio Shack, 1977

TRS-80 was Tandy Corporation's desktop microcomputer model line, sold through Tandy's Radio Shack stores in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first units, ordered unseen, were delivered in November 1977, and rolled out to the stores the third week of December. The line won popularity with hobbyists, home users, and small-businesses. Tandy Corporation's leading position in what Byte Magazine called the "1977 Trinity" (Apple, Commodore and Tandy) had much to do with Tandy's retailing the computer through more than 3000 of its Radio Shack (Tandy in Europe) storefronts. Notable features of the original TRS-80 included its full-stroke QWERTY keyboard, small size, its Floating Point BASIC programming language, an included monitor, and a starting price of $600. The pre-release price was $500 and a $50 deposit was required, with a money back guarantee at time of delivery. One major drawback of the original system was the massive RF interference it caused in surrounding electronics. This became a problem when it was determined to violate FCC regulations, leading to the Model I's phase out in favor of the new Model III. By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest available selection of software in the microcomputer market

Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair, 1982


The Timex Sinclair 1000 (TS1000) was the first computer produced by Timex Sinclair, a joint-venture between Timex Corporation and Sinclair Research. It was launched in July 1982. The TS1000 was a slightly modified Sinclair ZX81 with an NTSC RF modulator instead of a UK PAL (Units sold in Portugal have a PAL RF modulator) device and the onboard RAM doubled to 2 kB. The TS1000's casing had slightly more internal shielding but remained the same as Sinclair's, including the membrane keyboard. It had black and white graphics, and no sound. It was followed by an improved version, the Timex Sinclair 1500 (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000).

Timex Sinclair 1500, Timex Sinclair, 1983


The TS1500 was a slightly-upgraded development of the TS1000. Because of the big problem built around TS1000 in the US (keyboard and RAM Pack mainly), Timex Sinclair (TMX Portugal) designed TS1500 and offered it to Timex Corporation to solve the problems (RAM pack connection) and use the TS2000 (ZXSpectrum) silver case that were never used because they launched TS2068. It replaced the earlier machine's ZX81-like case with a ZX Spectrum-like case (in Silver), the same ZX Spectrum rubber keyboard, a custom ULA (it does not have the Ferranti ULA) and increased the onboard RAM to 16 KB (for more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1500#Timex_Sinclair_1500).

VC 4000, Interton, 1978


The VC 4000 is an early 8-bit cartridge-based game console released in Germany in 1978 by Interton. The console is quite obscure outside Germany, but many software compatible systems can be found in many European countries (see 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System). It's unclear if Interton really made the VC 4000 from scratch or if they bought the rights and the design to produce it, as many other brands produced similar systems the following years. The VC-4000 is powered by a Signetics 2650A CPU (same as the Arcadia 2001) and a Signetics 2636 Video Controller. The two controllers are composed of a 12-key keypad, 2 fire buttons and an analog joystick. On the control panel of the system, one can find an on/off switch and three buttons: RESET, SELECT and START.

Vectrex, General Consumer Electronics, 1982


The Vectrex is a vector display-based video game console that was developed by Western Technologies/Smith Engineering. It was licensed and distributed first by General Consumer Electric (GCE), and then by Milton Bradley Company after their purchase of GCE. It was released in November 1982 at a retail price of $199 ($440 compensated for inflation[1]); as Milton Bradley took over international marketing the price dropped to $150 and then $100 shortly before the video game crash of 1983. The Vectrex exited the market in early 1984. Unlike other non-portable video game consoles, which connected to televisions and rendered raster graphics, the Vectrex has an integrated vector monitor which displays vector graphics. The monochrome Vectrex uses plastic screen overlays to generate color and various static graphics and decorations. At the time, many of the most popular arcade games used vector displays, and GCE was looking to set themselves apart from the pack by selling high-quality versions of games such as Space Wars and Armor Attack. Vectrex comes with a built in game, the Asteroids-like Minestorm. Two peripherals were also available for the Vectrex, a light pen and a 3D imager. The Vectrex was also released in Japan under the name Bandai Vectrex Kousokusen. While it is a mainstay of disc-based console systems today, the Vectrex was part of the first generation of console systems to feature a boot screen, which also included the Atari 5200 and Colecovision.

You can select to have either mouse or joystick attached to the ports through the dipswitches. The Amiga detects external drives by querying them. Right now, only drives are added to the the system which have an image in them. There is still no keyboard emulation. This version supports many more gfx modes, sprites, input modes, etc and compatibility with many software has increased.  Rewrote large portions of the floppy controller. More games should load properly now.  Moved things around using banks, wHich decreased the overall memory requeriments for the driver from 16 megs to 2 megs.  Removed the extra 'chip' and 'extended' ram from the default configuration. The current memory setup should be the same as a stock A500 [Ernesto Corvi].

- 0.56.1: Fixed RAM configuration selection, now the original Heroquest will run [Kev Thacker, Richard Wilson].

- 0.37b5: Fixed some bugs in the disk image handling code used in the Amstrad CPC driver. Changed video hardware code to use 6845 CRTC code. Also added Eventlist code to the Amstrad video hardware code. It will record colour changes, mode changes and crtc register writes.  This means support for multi-modes on the same screen, colour changing effects, and demos. There is a second method which updates between I/O writes that would affect the screen. The rendering method can be chosen with a compile switch. Also added correct opcode timings for Amstrad using new cpu_setcycletable, this means raster effects are now correct. Also added emulation of the Multiface hardware. It requires a rom (optionally loaded). You must enable it in the dipswitches. When enabled F1 will be the "stop" button [Kev Thacker].

- 0.36b14: Minor improvements to the graphics display in the amstrad driver. A border is shown and the screen is centralised in the horizontal. Vertical centering not done properly done yet. Graphics routines use plot_pixel so work in 8-bit and 16-bit colour [Kev Thacker]. amstrad disk image support!  Thanks to nec765 floppy disc controller emulation. This provides loading of disk images in the CPCEMU standard and extended disk image formats (the most common format available on the net) [Kev Thacker].

- 0.36b7: amstrad driver (renamed to cpc6128) plays snapshots now! This now plays game snapshots created with the CPCEMU emulator or other CPC emulators [Kev Thacker].

Amiga fixes [Roberto Zandona]: Removed additional 2 cycles, in move operation, for non-Agnus registers. Set to #0 the start cycle in the copper operation. David Haywood refactored the CD32 code base to eliminate duplicate code between MAME and MESS. Atari Ace cleaned up a few include files in CD32 driver.

- 0.140u2: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed problems with i2cmem. Cubo CD32 games now save and load settings properly.

- 0.140u1: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed crash in machine\cubocd32.c (akiko_frame_proc).

- 0.139u4: Atari Ace converted Amiga drivers to use driver_devices. Merged common code between legacy Amiga and AGA video systems.

- 0.138u4: Removed machine\i2cmemdev.c/h. smf turned i2cmem into a C++ device & ditched the unused legacy device.

- 0.136u2: Curt Coder refactored the CIA 6526 interface, adding SP/CNT callbacks. Fixed serial transfer.

- 0.135u4: Curt Coder fixed CIA6526 FLAG handling and slight interface cleanup.

- 0.134: Robiza fixed 6526 CIA PRA, PRB, DDRA and DDRB ports and added partial fix to 6526 CIA timer: Avoid timer's desync in read count operation.

- 0.133u5: Robiza added different TOD implementation for CIA6526 and CIA8520.

- 0.132u4: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed Cubo CD32 framerate to 50Hz. Better fix for Amiga AGA ddf_stop_pixel, to avoid breaking Amiga 1200 startup screen.

- 0.132u3: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed AGA display window start and stop (fixes startup screen and lsrquiz & lsrquiz2 missing graphics). Changed visible area to 703x272. Added dipswitches 'DSW1 6' and 'DSW2 1->8'.

- 0.132u2: Cubo CD32 update [Stephane Humbert]: Fixed inputs and found why inputs are not read (protection ?), hacked to work now. Amiga AGA update [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Fixed sprite data fetching and sprite colors.

- 0.130u3: Added machine\i2cmemdev.c/h. Samuele Zannoli added device-based implementations of the EEPROM and I2C devices.

- 0.125u1: Robiza added feature to the cia6526: In READ operation the value can be forced by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS.

- 0.123u4: Zsolt Vasvari converted Amiga based games to partial updating and proper scanline based timers.

- 0.122u4: Updated Amiga driver to use formal XTALs [Dirk Best].

- 0.121u1: Nathan Woods added an API to access the current amiga_machine_interface.

- 0.120u2: Added machine\i2cmem.c. smf added generic I2C bus memory support. Hooked up to the cubocd32 driver.

- 0.118u5: Added machine\cubocd32.c and includes\cubocd32.h. CuboCD32/Amiga updates [Ernesto Corvi]: Finished implementing the CDROM controller, so now the games boot. Moved the entire Akiko code to machine/cubocd32.c to make things a little more easier to work with. Added CDDA audio support to the CDROM controller and driver. Systems with the AGA chipset no longer connect bit 0 of the CIA that was previously connected to the Overlay pin not connected. Made BLTDDAT return it's value. This is a readable register which we were not handling. Initialized the SERDATR register upon reset to reflect that the transfer buffer/shift reg is empty. Changed 68EC020 CPU1 clock speed to 14187580 Hz and visible area to 671x272. Added CD/DA sound and dipswitches 'Service Mode' and 'DSW1 2-8'.

- 0.118u4: Amiga updates [Erneso Corvi]: Implemented ECS-Only BLTCON0L register. Modified the amiga_interface structure to add a nmi callback and a flags variable. Added AGA chipmem mask definition. Added 32 bit data bus support to chipram. It's automatically used if the chipset is AGA. Added clock chip constants in machine/amiga.h for 68k PAL and NTSC, and 68EC00 NTSC. Updates drivers to use those constants. Added convenience macros to determine wether we're running with an ECS chipset, AGA chipset, or 'ECS or AGA chipset'. Changed autoconfig reads to return 0x0000 instead of 0xffff. Fixed MSB value timer reads on the 8520 cia. We were previously only updating the count for the timer when the LSB value was read. Added basic Akiko emulation to the cubocd32 driver. Both the Chunky to Planar converter, and the I2C NVRAM should be fully implemented, however, the CDROM functionality is not complete. It's only enough to make the kickstart pass the Akiko checks. Changed 68EC020 CPU1 clock speed to 14318180 Hz. Added Custom (3579545 Hz) sound and 'DSW1 1' dipswitch.

- 0.118u3: Amiga system updates [Ernesto Corvi]: Implemented the ECS-only BLTSIZV and BLTSIZH custom registers, and modified BLTSIZE and the blitter to use them. Properly implemented the bit in VPOSR that indicates if we're running on a PAL or NTSC Amiga.

- 0.117: Peter Rittwage reverted patch to the 6526CIA as it was causing issues with Amiga/Arcadia emulation.

- 0.115u3: Peter Rittwage fixed bit calculation in 6526cia.c which broke joysticks in the MESS C64 driver.

- 0.113u2: Changed VSync to 59.997000 Hz.

- 0.112u2: Added cubocd32.c driver.

TODO:

- Proper handling of the 68070's internal devices (UART,DMA,Timers etc.)

- Full emulation of the CDIC, SLAVE and/or MCD212 customs


WIP:

- 0.142u1: Fabio Priuli added support for a callback function to test softlist sharedfeat (e.g. 'compatibility') and display a warning message accordingly (cartslot.c/chd_cd.c). Updated CD-I driver as an example.

- 0.141u2: Cleaned up shared implementation of CDi [David Haywood]: Merged MESS CDi driver file with the MAME CDi driver file (used for Quizard). The cdimono1 system is now the parent / bios of Quizard, the Quizard games run on a retail CDi unit with Jamma adapter / dongle for protection so this is a logical step.

- 0.140: Considerably improved UART communications in the CD-i 68070 implementation, increasing Quizard stability as a result. Re-worked Quizard MCU communications handling to be more easily expanded [Harmony].

- 0.139u4: Added includes\cdi.h, machine\cdi070.c/h, cdicdic.c/h, cdislave.c/h and video\mcd212.c/h. Harmony added UART Tx/Rx framework to the CD-i 68070 implementation, necessary for Quizard protection. Changed default CD-i SLAVE video setting to PAL, necessary for Quizard to boot. Changed visible area to 384x280 and resolution of CD-i based arcade games. Replaced the excessively large Quizard patch scheme with a much smaller 4-byte patch plus basic protection obfuscation simulation. Temoved RAM protection patches from Quizard games. All games now at least boot with simulated protection, and the ones that were playable before remain playable. Also ported over CD-i cleanup from MESS. Added service mode and changed input from 2 to 8 buttons.

- 13th October 2010: Harmony - I futzed around a bit with the function that sends the initial 20 bytes to the protection device last night. I discovered that if I killed the random number that it used as a seed and made it 1, the game would simply dump out the key bytes. Heartened, I wrote some functionality to take those bytes and fashion an appropriate 8-byte return value from them, and with only a 4-byte patch to always return 1 rather than a nuclear NOP-out of nearly an entire function, all the games started firing up. Even better, I had a hunch that since the main CPU never sends any kind of key to the MCU, perhaps the values themselves are symmetric. It turns out that they are, and so any seed - not just 1 - will work with the same algorithm. So the patch could go, but the functionality stayed. Hooray - all the games will run with no RAM patching! Now for the bad part: Quizard 3.2, 4.1 and 4.2 all still refuse to go in-game for reasons unknown. They don't try to chat up the microcontroller in any way, so it must just be what the MCU is returning that they *eventually* don't like. Quizard 2.2, however, is fully playable. Pictures.

- 11th October 2010: Harmony - With some additional finagling, I've managed to get both Quizard 1.2 and Quizard 1.7 to be fully playable by either one or two players, along with service mode. Additionally, the protection check patches were able to be made partially generic, enabling Quizard 3.2 and Quizard Rainbow 4.1 to boot, go into attract mode, and coin up without much hassle. Unfortunately, both of them have some sort of additional checks before they'll go in-game. I can patch them with an additional poke, but that ventures into even more hacky territory than I'd like.

- 10th October 2010: Harmony - Using a targeted hack, I was able to get the 1.7 revision of Quizard to boot in MAME. Unfortunately, this looks like it's going to be pretty gnarly, as the MCU controls all inputs and DIP switches to the game. Yikes! (see http://harmoniouscode.blogspot.com/)

-  7th October 2010: Harmony - Astute readers of the MAME release notes may have noticed multiple revisions of a game added to MAME 0.139 called "Quizard". Quizard is noteworthy for being one of the few arcade games to be based on the Philips CD-i game console, and benefits from my ongoing CD-i work in MESS. Quizard consists of a standard CD-i console with a separate I/O board hooked up to both the front and rear serial ports, with a protected i8571 microcontroller in tow for copy protection. For anyone interested in seeing what the machine actually looks like, pop on over to Interactive Dreams and read the (short) article on the game: http://cdii.blogspot.com/2007/06/cd-i-arcade-conversions.html. The game currently fails to boot in MAME for unknown reasons which I am in the process of trying to track down. While it also fails to boot in CD-i Emulator, it does so for different reasons than it does in MESS - MESS seems to get stuck in an OS call shortly after the OS launches the cdi_quizard executable module, whereas CD-i Emulator loads it, tries to send data to the (non-existent) I/O board, then hangs while waiting for a response. The first order of business is going to be to get MESS into a state where it will run as far as CD-i Emulator does. This shouldn't be overly difficult, as I've almost narrowed down specifically where it's crashing. After that, I'll need to verify that the UART handling in MESS's SCC68070 implementation is okay. Lastly, a lot of guesswork to try to figure out just what the heck it is that it's trying to send to the microcontroller will be necessary, but that should be reasonable considering that much more nefarious protection is broken in MAME with some regularity. After that, everything should be peachy.

- 0.138u3: Added cdi.c driver and layout\cdi.lay.

- 0.142u4: Joe Caporale gave labels to many inputs in CPS1 games.

- 0.141u2: CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]: Added Tenchi wo Kurau (Japan Resale Ver.). Confirmed B-Board # for chikij, added ROMs positions, PALs and some PCB infos to video\cps1.c. Fixed sf2uk labels and added PCB infos. Identified and documented willowje as an early and genuine USA release, added a note and renamed willowje -> willowo.

- 0.139u2: CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]: Minor cleanups and fixes.

- 18th August 2010: Smitdogg - The box of Capcom goodies arrived today from Japan. They are Japanese versions of Knights of the Round, Willow, and King of Dragons. In Willow's case we got it to correct the current set using incorrect roms. But for the other 2, yet again, the program rom labels indicated new versions we don't have dumped and so far look to be matching currently dumped sets, or at least doing some mixmatching with program roms and different sizes on graphics roms. I'm not really sure yet to be honest, they aren't fully dumped yet. You'll see why when you see how many roms they use. I'll finish dumping them all tomorrow.

- 10th August 2010: Smitdogg - We won the Capcom games that I was raising money for a few days ago. They should arrive in about a week. There is other oldschool Capcom news on the way as well.

- 0.139u1: CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]: Expanded and updated games table in video\cps1.c. Confirmed B-Board # for 3wondersu and varth. Fixed labels in ghouls, ghoulsu to match real PCBs. Removed 14.bin in dynwarj, it was a bad dump. Marked nm_23.12b in nemoj BAD_DUMP. Removed knightsj set (roms were split & hacked to work on a suicided board). Added roms relationship between parent/clones where missing. Fixed some incorrect notes added in previous update. Reordered some sets. Minor cleanups. Fixed sf2ceua labels and added PCB infos. Fixed sf2ceub labels and added PCB infos, removed 1 incorrect rom and replaced with proper redump done by Dumping Union. Fixed punisher and punisheru Q-Sound labels and added D-Board PALs. Brian Troha set correct B-Board mapper for "resale" kits. This fixes missing graphics in Area 88 (Japan Resale). Documentation update for some CPS1 sets (B-Board chip information) verified via Team Japump PCB photos [Brian Troha].

- 1st August 2010: Smitdogg - Team Japump are dumping/fixing some CPS1 revisions. I got our bids in for the other needed Capcom revisions.

- 0.139: CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]: Added missing PALs as reference to most of remaining sets. Dumped and added TK24B1.1A to Dynasty Wars [Corrado Tomaselli]. Fixed LW-13.10D rom loading in Forgotten Worlds to match real PCB. Identified, verified and documented a ton of PCBs, adding/fixing missing/wrong infos as ROMs labels and positions, B-Board, C-Board and CPSB IDs and PALs [Stefan Lindberg, dlfrsilver, MKL]. Reordered all sets per release date in cps1.c and video\cps1.c. Updated games table in video\cps1.c and added some notes on PALs table. Minor cleanups.

- 0.136u1: Fabio Priuli fixed NVRAM for dino, punisher, wof and clones

- 0.135u4: Fabio Priuli added driver data struct and save states to CPS1 driver.

- 0.133u3: Corrado Tomaselli verified and added correct xtals values for CPS1 boards. Added correct xtal and divisor for OKI6295 taken from Forgotten Worlds schematics.

- 0.129u4: Nicola Salmoria fixed a contact MAMEDEV message in the CPS1 driver.

- 0.128u4: Updated CPS1 documentation [Nicola Salmoria].

- 0.127u1: Additional input port cleanups in the CPS1 driver [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.127: Nicola Salmoria updated CPS1 to use proper gfx ROMs (+ PALs) for Varth (Japan 920714), and to load correct A-Board PALs for QSound games.

- 0.126u5: Corrado Tomaselli and Charles MacDonald added reverse engineered PLD images to CPS1 games (A-board to all and B-board and C-board to many).

- 0.126u4: Corrado Tomaselli verified and corrected CPS1 refresh rate. Changed VSync to 59.610000 Hz.

- 0.125u6: Corrado Tomaselli changed all games after Street Fighter 2 CE to have a 12MHz clock. Verified on Mega Man and Quiz & Dragons (original kits with plastic case). I am resonably sure all the other games after ST2CE have the DASH CPS1 board with 12MHz clock.

- 0.125u3: David Haywood fixed duplicate input port bits in CPS1 driver.

- 0.124u5: Massive update to ROM naming in the CPS1 driver, also loading smaller EPROMs for Japanese sets instead of the larger mask ROMs where possible. Added information about B-Board revisions where possible. There is still work to do on this regard but this is a first step in untangling the mess [Nicola Salmoria]. Nicola Salmoria and Corrado Tomaselli verified more CPS1 gfx ROM mappings against PALs. Fixed rom names in all games.

- 0.124u4: Further CPS1 improvements [Nicola Salmoria, Corrado Tomaselli, Charles MacDonald]: Fixed layer enable at the end of stage 4 in Varth. Increased Varth CPU clock to 12MHz to reduce slowdowns (the game was released after sf2ce so the faster A-board was available). Verified more gfx rom mappings against PAL dumps (thanks to Corrado). Verified memory maps using A-board PAL dumps (thanks to Charles). Separated the address ranges for CPS-A and CPS-B customs. This finally clarifies why some registers are fixed and some change with every game. Identified three new unknown registers in the CPS-B-21 custom. Their purpose is unknown. All unhandled accesses to CPS-A/CPS-B registers will now be reported. There shouldn't be any left. Look out for "contact MAMEDEV" popups. Cleaned memory maps. Moved Forgotten Worlds special input memory handlers to DRIVER_INIT. Moved extra input handlers to video/cps1.c since the extra connectors are on the C-board. Added sound to Final Crash. Lowered SF2 clock speed to 10MHz. This is on the assumption that, since the 12MHz A-Board is called "89626A-4 DASH", it should have started to be used with SF2 DASH--that is, sf2ce.

- 0.124u3: Nicola Salmoria and Corrado Tomaselli fixed CPS1 palette control register to match tests on Magic Sword PCB. Nicola Salmoria verified several CPS1 graphics ROM mappings against PAL dumps. Nicola Salmoria merged CPS1, CPS2 memory maps and some tweaks from schematics, though to get perfect memory maps dumps of the A-board PALs would be needed.

- 0.124u2: Verified some GFX rom mapping tables against PAL dumps. Improved understanding and emulation of palette related registers [Nicola Salmoria, Corrado Tomaselli]. Nicola Salmoria removed CPS1 tile kludges and replaced with per-game ROM mapping tables. Ideally, the ROM mapping should be derived from mapping of the PALs found on the B board. Note that this is a significant change and some new bugs might be caused by it. Unlike previous bugs, where extra garbage tiles would appear in the games, the new bugs would be tiles or sprites MISSING--so they will be harder to notice. This would happen because in some cases the 16x16 regions of the gfx ROMs can be used by both scroll2 and sprites, while in other cases they must be separated.

- 0.124u1: Nicola Salmoria fixed CPS1 background color. This fixes 3 wonder (game start) and mtwins (explosion during attract). It seems to break Varth, however, and has dubious effects on the boot sscreens of avsp, sfa3 and possibly other CPS2 games. Changed palettesize to 3072 colors.

- 0.122u8: David Haywood fixed the CPS driver to at least display the correct clock in the driver info, by degrading the clock through alternate means.

- 0.121: Vas Crabb updated the DIP locations for all games in the CPS-1 driver.

- 0.114: Aaron Giles fixed a MAME crash if you do a hardware reset.

- 0.112u3: MAME Italia forum connected brightness support on the CPS1 board (not just CPS2) after verifying that the real board does support it.

- 0.109: Input port cleanup and additional comments in the CPS1 driver [Stephane Humbert].

- 0.105u1: David Haywood updated CPS-1 driver to more accurately draw tilemaps, based on evidence from a board with mixed ROMs.

- 5th April 2006: David Haywood - A guy called Murray posted on the MAME.net and neo-geo.com forums about a problem he was having with his Final Fight PCB. The problem looked like it might be due to a mix of Japanese and US roms as the Japanese roms don't contain a full Winners Don't Use Drugs Logo. He got a friend to dump the socketed roms on the PCB and sure enough the socketed graphic roms matched the Japanese set in MAME. This set, being a newer US revision was then plugged into MAME (ffightua in .105) but there was something wrong. MAME displayed the Winners Don't Use Drugs screen perfectly with this mixed set of roms. At this point I wondered if maybe one or both of his Mask Roms were also from a Japanese revision so I loaded the US set with an entire set of Japanese GFX. The logo was broken, but not in the same way as the PCB. For a while this was rather confusing, it must be getting the Japanese characters from somewhere, but the only place they exist are in the Japanese roms, and it would appear the text layer graphics aren't used in them when running the US set. No matter what I tried to change in terms of the roms I couldn't reproduce the exact problem shown. Then I remembered, MAME had some code to force the 8x8 text layer characters to always be drawn from the Left Hand Side of each 16x16 tile (apparently for Carrier Air Wing...) but the left and right sides of almost every 16x16 character used for the 8x8 layer were identical. The screenshot made it quite obvious that the real hardware does not always draw the left hand side of the tile, but instead alternates from left side to right side for every column on the display. By implementing this behavior in MAME I was able to reproduce the same glitch shown on the real PCB when mixed roms are used. I suspect the problem with Carrier Air Wing which resulted in the left hand side always being used is another problem, the CPS video hardware is full of strange little hacks for the early CPS games anyway. The change will hopefully be in 105u1, I can't see anything broken by it, but some testing would be helpful.

- 0.101u1: Phil Bennett corrected CPS1 frequencies based on measurements from a real PCB. Changed Z80 CPU2 clock speed to 3579545 Hz and YM2151 to 3579545 Hz. And changed 68000 CPU1 clock speed to 12MHz and Z80 CPU2 to 8MHz in games with Q-Sound.

0.62 [info from MAMEinfo]


TODO:

- (CoJag) map out unused RAM per-game via memory_nop_read/write

- (Jaguar) support is very poor, most games aren't properly playable or have severe performance issues or crashes related to the unsafe blitter code. Only Pinball Fantasies is fully playable albeit without sound.

- The code (GPU/DSP access) should probably be refactored around the 16-bit interface from the plain 68k, the driver currently uses trampoline functions due to the original driver being entirely 32-bit due to the CPUs on CoJag.


NOTES:

- Atari Jaguar (Home) & Atari CoJag (Arcade) hardware: The CoJag arcade system is based on the Jaguar system, but with an upgraded main CPU (68020 or MIPS instead of the plain 68000 found in the Jaguar).


WIP:

Changed around one of the #include paths (due to ProjectBuilder on Mac issues). Added support for objects with pitch != 1 for objects with 1-2 bits per pixels.

- 0.71u2: Nathan Woods added save state support to Cojag. Disables certain error logging and speedup hacks under MESS. get_jaguar_memory() now based on memory_get_read_ptr(). Jaguar blitter won't crash if it is instructed to blit to a weird address.

- 10th July 2003: Nathan Woods added save state support to the Cojag driver.

- 0.70u5: Nathan Woods fixed a potential crash in jaguar_tom_regs_w() (vidhrdw/jaguar.c), while this crash doesn't occur under normal execution of the cojag games though, it can occur if modified ROMs are being used.

Fixed name of Asante MC3NB card, added Apple NuBus Ethernet Card which the Asante is a perfect clone of, fixed 24-bit mirroring so ethernet cards work in all slots. Further improvements to Quadra 700; System 7.5.0 (and probably 7.1) will boot, but system remains NOT_WORKING due to many known flaws.

Added emulation of Moniterm Viking 1024x758 monochrome video card. Add 824gc NuBus video card (Apple 8*24 unaccelerated). Preliminary emulation of SuperMac Spectrum 8 Series III video card [Jonathan Gevaryahu, R. Belmont]. Preliminary work on Asante MC3B Ethernet card and DP8390x chip. m2hires and vikbw ignore the top 4 address bits and thus are compatible with macii -bios 1. Added full emulation of Apple Hi-Resolution video card. Fixed constructor weirdness for 48gc/824gc, gave video cards human-readable names. Added VRAM mirror to fix the vikbw card under System 7. WIP on accelerated SuperMac Spectrum PDQ video card. This card works fine in B&W and 16 color modes (where it is not accelerated). 256 colors w/ acceleration partially works but the blitter is not all figured out yet [R. Belmont].

Rewrote RBV-and-descendants interrupt handling in fake VIA2; solves occasional interrupt storms. Implemented another PMU command so PowerBook 140/170 can boot 7.5.5. Upgraded maciihmu to working, lots of preliminary-ish PowerMac 6100 work. Boot chime + blank screen is all you get so far. LC now starts up, original Mac II switched to HMMU, preliminary IIfx support. LC2, LC3 now start up [R. Belmont].

- 0.135: Various minor tweeks plus preliminary boot tone from models with the Apple Sound Chip. Greatly expanded support for post-68000 models. Many now POST and want a disk to boot from [R. Belmont]. Many updates [R. Belmont]:

  * Fixed ID readbacks for all models.

  * Fixed SCSI handshake on Mac II and later machines.

  * Fixed ADB timing to specs; prevents hangs of System >6.0.3 on ADB systems and improves mouse pointer smoothness.

TODO:

- Floppy interface doesn't seem to work at all with either floppy inserted or not, missing DMA irq?

- Proper 8251 uart hook-up on keyboard

- Boot is too slow right now, might be due of the floppy / HDD devices

PC-9801UX:

- POR mechanism makes this to die very soon (hack is unsuited for what this needs);

PC-9801RS:

- Floppy disk hook-up;

- POR mechanism isn't fully understood;

- Extra features;

- Clean-up duplicating code;

PC-9821:

- "Set the software dip-switch" warning;

Angelo Salese moved ST-V game-specific overrides from saturn.c/stvinit.c to stv.c, makes games to correctly return stv.c instead of saturn.c if you use -listsource. Moved change clock inside a timer and worked on NMI generation for SMPC, fixes most instances of 2 credits at start-up for ST-V games. Rewritten ST-V IOGA system from scratch. Converted VDP2 registers into proper 16-bits parallelism. Added MVOL to the SCSP core, used for sound fade in/out effects.

- 29th July 2011: Angelo Salese - More Sega Saturn WIP pics, based off the latest fixes for the system.

- 0.143u2: Various Sega Saturn / ST-V fixes, that allows correct sound in Baku Baku Animal and Funky Head Boxers, also removed instadma hack, used by Pebble Beach Golf and Funky Head Boxers. Added DSP end IRQ event in Sega Saturn / ST-V SCU DSP core [Angelo Salese].

- 0.143: Changed SH-2 CPU1/2 clock speed to 28636360 Hz, 68000 CPU3 to 11289600 Hz and VSync to 59.764793 Hz.

- 0.142u6: Many Sega ST-V / Saturn HW changes [Angelo Salese].

- 17th June 2011: Angelo Salese - Still working on Sega Saturn, and fixed many issues with it. Here goes some WIP pics (mostly taken from the official Sega Saturn WIP topic there, plus various in-development pics).

- 0.142u5: More accurate pixel clocks for Sega Saturn / ST-V [Angelo Salese]. Angelo Salese fixed an ST-V window effect bug when it's in double interlace mode, fixes a graphic bug with Virtual Mahjong. Fixed a rather silly bug with SCU DSP execute flag. Oliver Stoneberg fixed Sega Saturn / ST-V start-up crash that was happening on some ends. Added accurate hblank durations to Sega Saturn / ST-V HW [Angelo Salese, Corrado Tomaselli, Charles MacDonald]. Angelo Salese moved SMPC intback command inside a timer, removes a kludge for SMPC mask irq. Angelo Salese fixed emulation hangs in Pebble Beach and Funky Head Boxers. Added CD/DA audio and changed VSync to 59.826048 Hz.

- 27th May 2011: Angelo Salese - Fixed a SCU DSP bogus bug with flags, fixed SMPC intback command, moved it inside a command and hooked up the SMPC direct mode inputs. This allows the Sega Saturn console (SEGA 1994/5 Ver 1.01) to boot. The diagnostic cart (SEGA v0.5 1994) is now operational too, and it really shows how bad is our current Saturn emulation (and some very lovely Engrish as well.

- 26th May 2011: Angelo Salese - Starting from u4 cycle, I'm been busy into finally cleaning up the Sega Saturn / ST-V driver. After that, I've started to nail down the irq system/pixel clock again (that was pretty messy before), and got various things fixed (namely the Pebble Beach / Funky Head Boxers hang). All of this also caused Virtual Mahjong to finally show itself with correct gfxs during gameplay.

- 0.142u4: Added hash\stv.xml. Major clean-up and state machine conversion for the Sega ST-V / Saturn driver [Angelo Salese]. Implemented multi-cart support to ST-V driver [Angelo Salese, Tafoid]. Changed region user1 to game0.

- 0.142u2: Changed stv.c to saturn.c driver.

- 0.141u3: Aaron Giles fixed black screen after system checking in several stv.c sets.

- 0.141u1: Mariusz Wojcieszek added support for MSB shadows in STV VDP2. This improves Soukyugurentai shadows. Fixed rendering of not rotated RBG layer in STV VDP2. This fixes garbage on level 4 of Soukyugurentai. Added support for MSB enabled color calculation for sprites in STV. This improves some sprites in Soukyugurentai. Corrected bitmap palette number for RBG0 in STV VDP2. This fixes colors in boss gfx in Soukyugurentai level 4 & 5.

- 0.138u2: Angelo Salese splitted the ST-V protection handlings by per-game and added proper RTC support.

- 0.138u1: Angelo Salese added x/y boundary checking to ST-V bitmaps.

- 0.137u1: David Haywood added default NVRAMs to the ST-V driver.

- 0.137: Angelo Salese written a per-pixel function for the irq system in the ST-V driver, disabled by default.

- 0.133u3: Angelo Salese improved ST-V timer 1 irq behaviour. Pebble Beach still have issues with gameplay start though (writes lots of garbage for whatever reason, really worked for random chances before).

- 0.133u1: Angelo Salese added Screen Raw Params hook-up to the ST-V driver, fixes some of the current issues. Angelo Salese and Corrado Tomaselli hand-tuned ST-V pixel-clock to match measured fps from the PCB. Corrado Tomaselli verified and updated the vertical syncs on the ST-V motherboard. Changed visible area to 320x224 and VSync to 59.828244Hz.

- 0.131u1: Moved stv_vdp2_dynamic_res_change() function outside of VIDEO_UPDATE in ST-V [Angelo Salese].

- 0.128u6: R. Belmont re-ordered SCSP init to fix crash. This fixed SCSP assert in colmns97 and stress.

- 0.128u5: Angelo Salese fixed reversed VBLANK-IN/OUT events in ST-V. Fixed hanagumi/groovef 2 credits at start-up. Many improvements on the irq handling of the ST-V driver [Angelo Salese, Charles MacDonald]: Fixed a bug with irq timings. Added ODD bit emulation. Fixed vblank period timings. Optimized a bit the whole interrupt routines, getting a 4x speed gain. Fixed an irq mask handling bug. This fixed at least Astra SuperStars and Pebble Beach booting, but the latter still fails the timer 1 irq routines... Also fixed sokyugrt and shienryu freezes after the loading and patent screens. shienryu allows coins but that's it.

- 0.128u4: Pre-irq rewrite submission in ST-V driver [Angelo Salese]: Better management of hblank/vblank bits. Makes dynamic resolutions to be called with a timer instead of run-time. Makes dynamic resolutions to not be changed at every frame but only when there's an actual change. Removed all the read/write handler speed-up hacks, they aren't needed anymore and they were doing more damage than being useful. This fixes 'Golden Axe - The Duel' gameplay speed at the cost of breaking up 'Power Instinct 3 - Groove On Fight' coin counter at start-up. ST-V IRQ rewrite [Angelo Salese]: Removed several global hacks/game specific  hacks (SMPC irq bit/introdon irq register hack/pblbeach framebuffer hack plus some more). Note: Some games have issues with it, but they'll be hopefully fixed on the next couple of updates. Changed visible area to 704x512.

- 0.128u3: Various improvements in the ST-V driver [Angelo Salese]: Fixed bitmap zooming in Virtual Mahjong 2 - My Fair Lady. Worked around a major graphic bug in ElanDoree. Added some missing alpha blending effects, Pro Mahjong Kiwame S title screen needs it but it doesn't work yet due to other problems (still investigating). Fixed a crash bug with Astra SuperStars when the debugger is active.

- 0.128u1: Small cleanups to the ST-V driver [Angelo Salese]: Make some work for 'Magical Zunou Power', still not working. David Haywood cleaned up STV rom loading a bit.

- 0.127u1: Fabio Priuli fixed P1 and P2 Button 4 are duplicated.

- 0.126u3: R. Belmont enable strict PC relative loads for ST-V games; at least Cotton Boomerang needs them.

- 0.126u2: Brian Troha changed short names for STV BIOS back to single words.

- 0.126u1: Brian Troha added ST-V BIOS info based on text at 0x800 (byte swapped). Reorganized the BIOS list & description. Added the USA BIOS to Super Major League and it's a USA only cart.

- 0.125u5: Added includes\stv.h.

- 0.125u4: R. Belmont upped max directory size for ST-V/Saturn driver (machine\stvcd.c).

- 0.118: Mike Haaland fixed macros in stvcd.c to work with C89 compilers.

- 0.114u4: R. Belmont fixed crash due to lack of CD in the Success ST-V games.

- 0.114u2: R. Belmont updated stvcd to be working enough that most Saturn games at least die for some other reason, and a few actually do useful things. Also included a small update to the core cdrom code so you can fetch a sector without knowing in advance what format it is.

- 0.111u5: Nathan Woods updated the Sega Saturn VDP2 video driver to use the new BITMAP_ADDR* macros instead of using the line[] array.

- 0.110u5: Removed drivers\stvhacks.c, drivers\stvinit.c and machine\stvprot.c. David Haywood moved the ST-V protection related code into stvprot.c and added some notes about the decathlete protection and renamed stvhacks to stvinit, because it contains most of the inits as well as the speedhacks.

- 0.110u3: STV fixes [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: VDP2: Fixed vertical scrolling for RGB bitmaps (fixes corrupted gfx in batmanfr) and vertical line scrolling for zoomed layers (fixes corrupted backgrounds in astrass). STV: Added speedup for master sh2 in batmanfr.

- 0.110u2: More updates to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: VDP1: Added shading for sprites (used by znpwfv, cotton2, others), fixed sprite clipping (fixes incorrect sprites in znpwfv) and fixed transparency on colour lookup table sprites (fixes bad sprites in znpwfv). VDP2: Fixed caching of RGB layer (fixes bad backgrounds on bosses in rsgun), added additive blending for tilemaps and sprites (rsgun) and added vertical line scroll and linezoom (fixes diehard logo). STV: Improved speedups for diehard, fixed speedups for znpwfv and added preliminary save state support.

- 0.108u5: Another big update to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: scsp: Improved interrupt reset (diehard, dnmtdeka and vfkids). colmns97 have sound now. vdp1: Added mesh effect for the sprites and polylines. vdp2: optimized rbg rendering. stv: Added speedups for dnmtdeka and diehard and corrected some set names/descriptions.

- 0.105u1: Aaron Giles modified a number of drivers that were using empty RAM regions for RAM or which had extraneous memory regions. Most significant changes were to the arcadia, nss and stv drivers.

- 0.105: zozo added the Dev 1.061 and early Japan BIOSes for ST-V: 'stv1061.bin' = ST-V Dev BIOS (1.061) - Sega 1994, Noted "ST-V Ver 1.061 94/11/25" on EPROM sticker, coming from a S-TV SG5001A dev board and 'epr-17740.bin' = ST-V BIOS (Japan early) - Sega 1995, found on a early board dated 02/1995.

- 0.104u7: Aaron Giles fixed stv.c games which always resets at the begining.

- 0.103: More ST-V updates [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Added idle loop skipping for Radiant Silvergun, added RBG caching, added RBG "two screens" mode, added Critter Crusher (not working due to missing inputs) and fixed several bugs introduced recently with all the other changes. R. Belmont completely rewrote machine/stvcd.c and .h. There's a lot less there now, but what's there is more understandable and works much better.

- 0.102u4: Major update to the STV driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: SH2: Introduced cpu_readop16() for opcode fetching. STV: Added idle skip to various games. STV: Ooptimized master/slave sh2 syncing. VDP1: Fixed sprite transparency for RGB sprites. VDP2: Added linescroll. VDP2: Added 16x16 15bit tiles (fixes missing gfx in znpwfv). VDP2: Optimized tilemap scrolling, bitmaps and framebuffer drawing. VDP2: Fixed page and map calculation. DSP: Fixed some bugs making vfremix run up to the end of second match.

- 9th December 2005: Mariusz Wojcieszek - Speedup for most of the 2D games in ST-V driver! For example with a Athlon 3000: Princess Clara Daisakusen (60 fps), Soukyugurentai (60 fps), Suikoenbu (60 fps), Power Instinct 3 (55 fps), Cotton 2 (45-50 fps) and Cotton Boomerang (45-50 fps).

- 0.99u8: Improvements to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Added another checking for DMA parameters and changed STV V-blank timing. vdp1: implemented two framebuffers and flipping, vdp1: Added manual changing and erasing of framebuffers, vdp1: Added manual trigger for drawing, vdp1: mapped framebuffer into memory (for 16bpp only), vdp1: Added shadow and half luminance for RGB sprites, vdp2: fixed bitmaps scrolling (fixes bad gfx in batmanfr and bakubaku intro), vdp2: Added preliminary window effect for tilemaps and sprite layer (for batmanfr) and vdp2: Added scaling for 8bpp and 15bpp bitmaps (fixes vmahjong and myfairld backgrounds).

- 0.99u7: Angelo Salese improved emulation of the IC13 ROM loading in ST-V driver. Find Love, Decathlete, Soukyugurentai / Terra Diver can boot without hacks or debug tricks. Also Suikoenbu has improved gameplay.

- 0.99u3: Updates to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: vdp2: Added rotation in RBG0 layer (improves diehard, vfkids, vfremix, thunt, sassisu backgrounds), vdp2: Added 15bit RGB tilemaps (used by thunt), vdp2: Added opaque alpha blended bitmaps (fixes missing gfx in shienryu intro), vdp2: Added enable bit for RGB sprites (fixes some bad sprites in vfremix), vdp2: Added alpha blending for RGB sprites, vdp1: Fixed polygon drawing, vdp1: Added line drawing, sh2: Fixed bug in division unit, sh2: Added callback called when cpu reads FTCSR register (intended for idle loop skipping for slave sh2 in stv), stv: Added idle loop skipping for several games and dsp: Fixed DMA (fixes some bad gfx in thunt).

- 0.97u1: Ville Linde fixed a minor bug in the SCSP timer handling.

- 0.96: A number of ST-V improvements [Angelo Salese]: Fixed a DSP bug which was causing Treasure Hunt to hang. The game is working but with graphics artifacts because of other DSP bugs... Added the possibility on the VDP1 to double the horizontal resolution under some circumstances. This affects Astra SuperStars, Virtual Mahjong & Virtual Mahjong 2. Fixed a bug in the A-Bus protection handling for games which have rom data mapped here. Made some small fixes to the SCU. Added a quick hack to avoid the sound reading "hang", disabled by default. There's also some WIP code for the protection in Astra SuperStars and Final Fight Revenge.

- 0.95u2: Angelo Salese fixed some interrupt issues because the old implementation was giving several hangs on Batman Forever. To be more specific added the sprite draw end irq to the INTERRUPT_GEN structure and fixed a bug which prevented the vblank bit to not be cleared if the irq mask has the VBLANK-IN disactivated. Also fixed the NMI_disable/enable cmds on the SMPC device, which active/disactive a bit in the SMPC ram. And fixed a bug in the bitmap type 4 in VDP2 handling.

- 0.91u2: ST-V update [Angelo Salese]: Added some new VDP-2 registers, for example the DISP one for avoid transitions draws. Re-added the layer disable/enable code that I sent in the past which was lost and removed the possibility to disable layers with non-debug builds. Started to add default EEproms for the various games, for now I've hooked up the one in Shienryu to let it run already with Vertical Switch. Added the dynamic clocks, hopefully now 100% working. Changed clock speed of the 2x SH-2 CPUs to 28636400 Hz and the 68000 to 11454560 Hz.

- 0.90u4: Angelo Salese started to work with the A-Bus protection, it is a sort of data transfer with the cartridge area, more info in the stv.c file. Current implementation just fixes character selection screens in sss, Angelo will work out about this one in the future, it has various "interesting" issues which was thought to be emulation probs(i.e booting in rsgun, textures in elandore etc.). Added a preliminary timer 1 irq handling, it fixes Pebble Beach booting but it doesn't work yet because of incomplete VDP-1 emulation. Noticed that ignoring VDP-1 long word access read by SH-2 isn't correct and not needed (because 'Steep Slope Sliders' is protected rather than using an illegal procedure), it was causing wrong graphics in Funky Head Boxers and boot errors in Pebble Beach, reversed it back to default. Changed clock speed of the 2x SH-2 to 26874100 Hz and the 68000 to 10749640 Hz.

- 18th January 2005: Angelo Salese - Started to work out the ST-V protection in Steep Slope Sliders. It is a sort of data transfer. The other protected games are: Astra SuperStars, Fighting Dragon Legend Elan Doree, Final Fight Revenge and Radiant Silvergun. Will be worked out in the next future. Pebble Beach Golf,still not working due to video emulation/irq probs and no,it's not Sea Bass Fishing.

- 0.90u2: ST-V update [Angelo Salese]. Fixed a bug with the VDP-1 ram reading, SH-2 can do byte or word access, it's implicit that can't do long word access. This fixes the Steep Slope Sliders booting so the game now works. VDP-1 PTM's "draw by request" was actually causing sprites to flicker in kiwames, reversed back to old implementation until I or somebody else understand what the current issue is (clear_framebuffer?). Finished the game header update, let me know if you like/don't like the system used for the description of the games. Fixed ST-V visible area to 704x513, which was causing Virtual Mahjong 2 to crash after the sound ram check, fixed a window effect bug in Double-density interlace mode, this fixes some graphics in vmahjong & myfairld. Guessed a bitmap positioning issue in double-density interlace mode, this fixes the NBG1 positioning in myfairld.

- 0.90: Angelo Salese fixed various DMA bugs, including a missing save/update mode in indirect mode and added a default add value for the A-Bus transfer, to avoid strange uploads. Further improved the SCU emulation, added two unemulated irqs (PAD and SCSP), improved the "illegal" DMA operations and started to work out with the games headers. Changed clock speed of the 2x SH-2 CPUs to 28636350 Hz and the 68000 CPU3 to 11454540 Hz in all games.

- 0.88u5: SCU DSP update [Angelo Salese]: Finished flags in ALU opcodes and SR opcode: MSB does not change.

- 0.83: Mariusz Wojcieszek added VDP2 layer disabling based on VRAM cycle pattern registers - this fixes gfx glitches in shanhigw title screen, added VDP1 half transparency - this improves sprites alpha blending in shanhigw in-game, and added VDP1 Gouraud shading (for normal sprites only) - this adds highlighting for selected tiles in shanhigw.

- 0.82u2: ST-V updates [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Fixed the bad RGB sprites colors and incorrect sprite clipping, added color offset for RGB sprites and fixed horizontal scrolling for bitmaps (corrects mausuke ingame background).

- 0.82u1: ST-V VDP-1/2 update [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Converted VDP1 drawing (sprites) to use framebuffer, added sprite priorities (corrects shanhigw ingame and colmns97 title screen), added color offset for sprites, improved sprites alpha blending (improves ejihon and shienryu intro), added framebuffer interlace (fixes elandore character selection screen), added color offset for bitmaps and added vertical scrolling for bitmaps (corrects shanhigw ingame). The main result (visible to user) of these changes is that shanhigw is now playable without problems (apart from gfx glitches on title screen). Fixed a window mode bug in STV VDP-2.

- 15th April 2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed a sprite rendering bug in the ST-V driver where some sprites got distorted to the wrong size, improving Othello Shiyouyo title screen, helicopter in Die Hard Arcade, attract modes in Cotton Boomerang and Hanagumi Taisen Columns and it also makes Super Major League almost playable.

- 0.81u4: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed sprites in groovef which is now playable, adds some RBG0 scrolling which greatly improves background graphics in cotton2, cottonbm, grdforce and othellos.

- 31st March 2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek sent in an update to the ST-V driver, adding support for the end code feature in VDP1 which improved sprites in Columns '97, Ejihon Tantei Jimusyo, Shienryu and fixing some bugs in the SCU DSP emulation.

- 0.80u2: ST-V update [Angelo Salese]. Fixed bitmap transparencies, added the RBG0 layer (no scroll/roz effects yet), added a really preliminary window effect (just for get tile-based sprites in shanhigw) and readded the VDP1 PTM register support which has been lost in the past.

- 0.80u1: Mariusz Wojcieszek improved scaling tilemap backgrounds. Backgrounds in vfkids, colmns97 and vfremix are better now. Fixed a problem where entering and existing service mode during game causes master/slave communication to fail. It turned out that slave cpu should be reset when it is turned off and on. This helps all games in driver.

- 0.80: Various ST-V improvements (brightness controls) [Angelo Salese].

- 28th February 2004: Angelo Salese added RGB brightness control to VDP2 in the ST-V driver and kludged Power Instinct 3 so that it boots (it has missing sprites though).

- 0.79: Olivier Galibert updated the ST-V driver to use new memory system, cleaning up the map.

- 21st January 2004: Olivier Galibert merged the ST-V driver memory maps and Aaron Giles fixed a problem in it.

- 20th January 2004: R. Belmont fixed many things in the ST-V sound system and as a result many more games have working sound in that driver.

- 19th January 2004: R. Belmont - Fixed some ST-V bugs, sound now works in a lot more games (but not Die Hard or Baku Baku yet, still tracing).

- 16th January 2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek improved the ST-V driver sprite color calculation, fixing problems with Shienryu sprite colors and Winter Heat character selection screen.

- 0.78u4: Some ST-V alpha blending [Mariusz Wojcieszek] (see bakubaku playfield, mausuke playfield, shienryu clouds etc.).

- 0.78u1: Improvements to ST-V emulation [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Changes to sprites color calculation. I fixed it using in color bank modes by using color offset register from VDP2. Now shienryu kludge is no longer needed and also sprite colors in Winter Heat and Virtua Fighter Kids are correct. Changes for Princess Clara Daisakusen (prikura) so that game is playable now (as far I tested it). Prikura tried to render distorted sprites with xsize = 0 or ysize = 0 and this caused crash. As these values are prohibited according to manual, I ignore distorted sprites with xsize = 0 or ysize = 0. I found that missing MINIT for slave to run the sprites is done by using address 0x01406f40 instead of 0x01000000. I'm not sure if my change is a hack or real hardware behaves in that way, but in my opinion it is possible that whole range of addresses (0x01000000 - 0x017fffff) is used for MINIT. I added MINIT only for one address used by prikura. Bad sprite colors were fixed in point 1. Small change for vdp2: commented out a call to usrintf_showmessage().

- 0.77u3: ST-V Improvements [Angelo Salese, Mariusz Wojcieszek].

- 11th December 2003: Mariusz Wojcieszek submitted an improvement to the SCU DSP emulation in the ST-V driver, but Virtua Fighter Remix still doesn't work properly.

- 26th November 2003: R. Belmont and ElSemi fixed various bugs in the SCSP sound core, improving the sound greatly in the ST-V driver.

- 0.77u1: Minor cleanups to the ST-V driver (specifically changed some variables to static) [Nathan Woods].

- 0.77: Added machine\stvcd.c. Various ST-V improvements [Angelo Salese]. Removed some unknown dipswitch entries.

- 0.76u2: Added drivers\stvhacks.c. Several ST-V games are probably now playable, however be warned many are very very slow, this is not a bug, sound is still poor or non-existant in most titles, these haven't been tested for long so could easily fail at later levels. Games which were marked as working in previous updates are also improved (shienryu etc.) [David Haywood, Angelo Salese, Olivier Galibert].

- 29th October 2003: Olivier Galibert added distorted sprite drawing to the ST-V driver, adding 3D graphics in a lot of games. David Haywood added sprite zoom to the ST-V driver, and a few more games show some graphics now: Cotton 2, Cotton Boomerang, Columns 97, Die Hard, Ejihon Tantei Jimusyo, Virtua Fighter Kids, Virtua Fighter Remix, Funky Head Boxers, Othello Shiyouyo, Pro Mahjong Kiwame S, Winter Heat and Taisen Tanto-R Sashissu!!

- 28th October 2003: David Haywood fixed the controls in the ST-V driver, making Mausuke no Ojama the World and Puyo Puyo Sun fully playable, but Puyo Puyo Sun is extremely slow.

- 27th October 2003: R. Belmont fixed the ST-V crash that happened with -nosound.

- 0.76u1: Added YMF292-F_SCSP stereo sound. More ST-V Improvements, fixing various graphical issues (Shienryu Sprite Colours) and general other bits and pieces. More games are 'watchable' now, for example Cotton 2, Cotton Boomerang, Puyo Puyo Sun, Columns 97 however they lack controls [David Haywood]. R. Belmont ported ElSemi's SCSP core, this gives preliminary sound in the ST-V games, however at the moment most of them play static, Shienryu is mostly correct.

- 25th October 2003: R. Belmont added ElSemi's SCSP sound chip emulator to the ST-V driver, but the sound and music only works properly in Shienryu.

- 23rd October 2003: Leon van Rooij sent in an update to the Windows Direct3D code, fixing a bug that caused a black screen in rotated ST-V games.

- 0.76: Various ST-V and SH-2 improvements, shienryu is improved as are many other games but no more are really playable yet [David Haywood, Olivier Galibert, sthief, Angelo Salese]. Changed visible area to 704x480 in all games.

- 11th October 2003: Brian Troha added the European BIOS to the ST-V driver.

- 0.74u1: Further ST-V improvements [Angelo Salese, David Haywood].

- 0.74: More ST-V Improvements [Angelo Salese, David Haywood].

- 0.73: Added vidhrdw\stvvdp1.c and vidhrdw\stvvdp2.c. Many Improvements to the ST-V emulation, resulting in Hanagumi Columns being playable and other games on the driver starting to show some graphics [Angelo Salese, David Haywood].

- 1st September 2003: David Haywood and Angelo Salese submitted a major improvement to the Sega ST-V driver with Hanagumi Taisen Columns - Sakura Wars fully playable, except it's missing sound.

- 0.72u2: Angelo Salese did various ST-V improvements, Hanagumi Columns shows a partial title screen (still disabled so you'll have to enable it yourself if you want to see).

- 24th August 2003: Angelo Salese sent in more improvements to the Sega ST-V driver, adding extended modes to the dynamic resolution change and improving the graphics emulation a little.

- 17th August 2003: Angelo Salese sent in an update to the Sega ST-V driver, improving IRQ support, VBLANK interrupts and basic DMA support.

- 25th July 2003: Angelo Salese fixed some things in the ST-V driver.

- 25th June 2003: Angelo Salese sent in a small update to the ST-V driver, adding color RAM emulation but it's not improved otherwise.

- 0.68: Added cpu1 BIOS rom to the stvbios.zip.

- 26th April 2003: David Haywood added a bunch of new ROM sets to the ST-V driver but none of them work.

- 0.63: Added stv.c driver. NOTES: Built to run the rom test mode only, don't consider anything here too accurate. We only run 1 sh2, not both, vidhrdw is just made to display BIOS text, interrupts are mostly not done, most smpc commands not done, no scu / dsp stuff, no sound, you get the idea ;-) 40ghz pc recommended once driver is finished. Any rom which has a non-plain loaded rom at 0x2200000 (or 0x2000000, i think it recognises a cart at either) appears to fail its self check, reason unknown, the roms are almost certainly not bad its a mystery. This hardware comes above hell on the great list of hellish things as far as emulation goes anyway.

- 10th December 2002: David Haywood mostly fixed the ROM loading in the Sega ST-V driver but it isn't otherwise improved.

- 5th December 2002: David Haywood sent in an extremely preliminary Sega ST-V driver that only loads the ROMs and runs the BIOS to some extent.

- 15th May 2002: Guru - Huge thanks to Malcolm McKay for a very nice loan of his wonderful STV cart collection including a main board and no less than 20 STV carts.

ToDo:

* Discrete sound emulation CPU frequency needs to be derived from the schematics, there is no oscillator on board, just an NE555 circuit BIOS needs to be redumped as 4 separate ROMs Notes The various color-enabled PAL region clones of RCA Studio II will be emulated as soon as the BIOS has been dumped.
